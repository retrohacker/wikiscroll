{"title":"Resonance","summary":"Resonance describes the phenomenon of increased amplitude that occurs when the frequency of a  periodically applied force (or a Fourier component of it) is equal or close to a natural frequency of the system on which it acts. When an oscillating force is applied at a resonant frequency of a dynamic system, the system will oscillate at a higher amplitude than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies.[3]","image":"Resonance.PNG.webp"}
