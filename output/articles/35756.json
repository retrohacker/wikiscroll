{"title":"Power set","summary":"In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.[1] In axiomatic set theory (as developed, for example, in the ZFC axioms), the existence of the power set of any set is postulated by the axiom of power set.[2] The powerset of S is variously denoted as P(S), 𝒫(S), P(S), P ( S ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} (S)} , ℘(S) (using the \"Weierstrass p\"), or 2S. The notation 2S, meaning the set of all functions from S to a given set of two elements (e.g., {0, 1}), is used because the powerset of S can be identified with, equivalent to, or bijective to the set of all the functions from S to the given two elements set.[1]","image":"cfaf27b30a718eaec3fd622808a397324a0cb558.svg","url":"Power_set"}
