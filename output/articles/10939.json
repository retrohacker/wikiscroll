{"title":"Connectivity (graph theory)","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, connectivity is one of the basic concepts of graph theory: it asks for the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to separate the remaining nodes into two or more isolated subgraphs.[1] It is closely related to the theory of network flow problems. The connectivity of a graph is an important measure of its resilience as a network.","image":"Network_Community_Structure.svg.png.webp","url":"Connectivity_(graph_theory)"}
