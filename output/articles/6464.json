{"title":"Biceps","summary":"The biceps or biceps brachii (Latin: musculus biceps brachii, \"two-headed muscle of the arm\") is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is attached to the upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm.  Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps screws in the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion).[2]","image":"1120_Muscles_that_Move_the_Forearm_Humerus_Flex_Sin.png.webp"}
