{"title":"Luminous intensity","summary":"In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction per unit solid angle, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit of luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.","image":"Luminosity.svg.png.webp","url":"Luminous_intensity"}
