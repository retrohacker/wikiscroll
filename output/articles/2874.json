{"title":"Algebraic number","summary":"An algebraic number is a number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with integer (or equivalently, rational) coefficients.  For example, the golden ratio, ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 {\\displaystyle (1+{\\sqrt {5}})/2} , is an algebraic number, because it is a root of the polynomial x2 - x - 1. That is, it is a value for x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.  As another example, the complex number 1 + i {\\displaystyle 1+i} is algebraic because it is a root of x4 + 4.","image":"8834bbd69c7f1eddf70573ed4296941c18c25ee5.svg","url":"Algebraic_number"}
