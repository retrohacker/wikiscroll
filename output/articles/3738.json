{"title":"Animal locomotion","summary":"Animal locomotion, in ethology, is any of a variety of methods that animals use to move from one place to another.[1] Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders), rolling (some beetles and spiders) or riding other animals (phoresis).","image":"Bioluminescent_beetle_Elateroidea_-_animated.gif"}
