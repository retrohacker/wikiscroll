{"title":"Cease and desist","summary":"A cease and desist letter is a document sent to an individual or business to stop allegedly illegal activity. The phrase \"cease and desist\" is a legal doublet, made up of two near-synonyms.  The letter may warn that, if the recipient does not discontinue specified conduct, or take certain actions, by deadlines set in the letter, that party, i.e. the letter's recipient, may be sued.[1][2] When issued by a public authority, a cease and desist letter, being \"a warning of impending judicial enforcement\",[3] is most appropriately called a \"cease and desist order\".","image":"ABS-CBN_broadcast_sign-off_on_May_5%2C_2020.png.webp"}
