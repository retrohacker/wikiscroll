{"title":"Cthulhu","summary":"Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft. It was first introduced in his short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\",[2] published by the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in a shape like a green octopus, dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe, the Cthulhu Mythos, where it exists with its fellow entities.","image":"Cthulhu_and_R'lyeh.jpg.webp"}
