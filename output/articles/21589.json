{"title":"If I Were a Boy","summary":"\"If I Were a Boy\"  is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé, from her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). \"If I Were a Boy\" was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad, who also handled its production alongside Beyoncé. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. Beyoncé then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Beyoncé was releasing it as a single, but eventually, they reached an agreement. Columbia Records released \"If I Were a Boy\" to US radio on October 8, 2008, as a double A-side single album's alongside \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" as the lead singles. The two songs showcased the contrast between Beyoncé's personality and her aggressive onstage persona, Sasha Fierce. A Spanish version of the song, titled \"Si Yo Fuera un Chico\", was digitally released in Mexico and Spain.","image":"Beyonce_-_If_I_Were_a_Boy_(single).png.webp"}
