{"title":"Surety","summary":"In finance, a surety /ˈʃʊərɪtiː/, surety bond or guaranty involves a promise by one party to assume responsibility for the debt obligation of a borrower if that borrower defaults. Usually, a surety bond or surety is a promise by a surety or guarantor to pay one party (the obligee) a certain amount if a second party (the principal) fails to meet some obligation, such as fulfilling the terms of a contract. The surety bond protects the obligee against losses resulting from the principal's failure to meet the obligation. The person or company providing the promise is also known as a \"surety\" or as a \"guarantor\".","image":"Johnny-automatic-scales-of-justice.svg.png.webp","url":"Surety"}
