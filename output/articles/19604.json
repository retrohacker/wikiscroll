The site takes its name from a modern village located near the former course of the Ravi River which now runs 8 km (5.0 mi) to the north. The current village of Harappa is less than 1 km (0.62 mi) from the ancient site. Although modern Harappa has a legacy railway station from the British Raj period, it is a small crossroads town of 15,000 people today.","image":"View_of_Granary_and_Great_Hall_on_Mound_F_-_Archaeological_site_of_Harappa.jpg.webp"}
