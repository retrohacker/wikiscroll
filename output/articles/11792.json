{"title":"Cyclic group","summary":"In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a cyclic group or monogenous group is a group that is generated by a single element.[1] That is, it is a set of invertible elements with a single associative binary operation, and it contains an element g such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to g or its inverse. Each element can be written as a power of g in multiplicative notation, or as a multiple of g in additive notation.  This element g is called a generator of the group.[1]","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Cyclic_group"}
