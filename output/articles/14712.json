{"title":"Emmy Noether","summary":"Amalie Emmy Noether[lower-alpha 1] (US: /ˈnʌtər/, UK: /ˈnɜːtə/ NUR-tər; German: [ˈnøːtɐ]; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German mathematician who made many important contributions to abstract algebra. She discovered Noether's theorem, which is fundamental in mathematical physics.[1] She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.[2][3] As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed some theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.[4]","image":"Noether.jpg.webp","url":"Emmy_Noether"}
