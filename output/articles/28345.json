{"title":"Manure","summary":"Manure is organic matter that is used as organic fertilizer in agriculture. Most manure consists of animal feces; other sources include compost and green manure. Manures contribute to the fertility of soil by adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen, that are utilised by bacteria, fungi and other organisms in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the  fungi  and bacteria in a chain of life that comprises the soil food web.","image":"Hestemøj.jpg.webp","url":"Manure"}
