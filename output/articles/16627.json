{"title":"Force","summary":"In physics, a force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (e.g. moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.  It is measured in the SI unit of newton (N). Force is represented by the symbol F (formerly P).","image":"Force_examples.svg.png.webp"}
