{"title":"Radio frequency","summary":"Radio frequency (RF) is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency[1] range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz. This is roughly between the upper limit of audio frequencies and the lower limit of infrared frequencies;[2][3] these are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as radio waves.  Different sources specify different upper and lower bounds for the frequency range.","image":"Radio_icon.png.webp","url":"Radio_frequency"}
