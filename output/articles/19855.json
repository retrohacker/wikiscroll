{"title":"Heap (data structure)","summary":"In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete[1] tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[2] The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.","image":"Max-Heap-new.svg.png.webp","url":"Heap_(data_structure)"}
