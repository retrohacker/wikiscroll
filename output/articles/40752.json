{"title":"Simpson's paradox","summary":"Simpson's paradox, which also goes by several other names, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics,[1][2][3] and is particularly problematic when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations.[4] The paradox can be resolved when confounding variables and causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling.[4][5] Simpson's paradox has been used to illustrate the kind of misleading results that the misuse of statistics can generate.[6][7]","image":"Simpson's_paradox_continuous.svg.png.webp","url":"Simpson's_paradox"}
