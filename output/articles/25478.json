{"title":"Language","summary":"A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or often writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound etc.), it is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems.[1] It has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning.","image":"Tepantitla_mural%2C_Ballplayer_A_(Daquella_manera).jpg.webp","url":"Language"}
