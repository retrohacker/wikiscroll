{"title":"South China tiger","summary":"The South China tiger is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is native to southern China.[2] The population mainly inhabited the Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996 and is possibly extinct in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded since the late 1980s.[1] In the late 1990s, continued survival was considered unlikely because of low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, and other human pressures.[3] In the fur trade, it used to be called Amoy tiger.[4]","image":"2012_Suedchinesischer_Tiger.JPG.webp","url":"South_China_tiger"}
