{"title":"Ernst Röhm","summary":"Ernst Julius Günther Röhm (German: [ˈɛɐ̯nst ˈʁøːm]; 28 November 1887 – 1 July 1934) was a German military officer and an early member of the Nazi Party. As one of the members of its predecessor, the German Workers' Party, he was a close friend and early ally of Adolf Hitler and a co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA, \"Storm Units\"), the Nazi Party's militia, and later was its commander. By 1934, the German Army feared the SA's influence and Hitler had come to see Röhm as a potential rival, so he was executed during the Night of the Long Knives.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-15282A%2C_Ernst_Röhm_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Ernst_Röhm"}
