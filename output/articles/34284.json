{"title":"Pearson correlation coefficient","summary":"In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC, pronounced /ˈpɪərsən/) ― also known as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), the bivariate correlation,[1] or colloquially simply as the correlation coefficient[2] ― is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations; thus it is essentially a normalised measurement of the covariance, such that the result always has a value between −1 and 1. As with covariance itself, the measure can only reflect a linear correlation of variables, and ignores many other types of relationship or correlation. As a simple example, one would expect the age and height of a sample of teenagers from a high school to have a Pearson correlation coefficient significantly greater than 0, but less than 1 (as 1 would represent an unrealistically perfect correlation).","image":"Correlation_coefficient.png.webp","url":"Pearson_correlation_coefficient"}
