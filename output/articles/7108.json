{"title":"Boeing 737 MAX groundings","summary":"The Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliner was grounded worldwide between March 2019 and December 2020 – longer in many jurisdictions – after 346 people died in two crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) resisted grounding the aircraft until March 13, 2019, when it received evidence of accident similarities. By then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane,[3] and by March 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded.","image":"Boeing_737_MAX_grounded_aircraft_near_Boeing_Field%2C_April_2019.jpg.webp","url":"Boeing_737_MAX_groundings"}
