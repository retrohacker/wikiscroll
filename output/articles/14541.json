{"title":"Elimination reaction","summary":"An elimination reaction is a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one- or two-step mechanism.[2] The one-step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction.  The numbers refer not to the number of steps in the mechanism, but rather to the kinetics of the reaction: E2 is bimolecular (second-order) while E1 is unimolecular (first-order). In cases where the molecule is able to stabilize an anion but possesses a poor leaving group, a third type of reaction, E1CB,  exists.  Finally, the pyrolysis of xanthate and acetate esters proceed through an \"internal\" elimination mechanism, the Ei mechanism.","image":"EliminationReactionCyclohexene.svg.png.webp","url":"Elimination_reaction"}
