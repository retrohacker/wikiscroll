{"title":"Neckerchief","summary":"A neckerchief (from neck (n.) + kerchief[1]), sometimes called a necker, kerchief or scarf, is a type of neckwear associated with those working or living outdoors, including farm labourers, cowboys and sailors.  It is most commonly still seen today in the Scouts, Girl Guides and other similar youth movements. A neckerchief consists of a triangular piece of cloth or a rectangular piece folded into a triangle.  The long edge is rolled towards the point, leaving a portion unrolled.  The neckerchief is then fastened around the neck with the ends either tied or clasped with a slide or woggle.","image":"Neckerchief.jpg.webp"}
