{"title":"Vacuum","summary":"A vacuum is a space devoid of matter. The word is derived from the Latin adjective vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\".  An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure.[1]  Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is considerably lower than atmospheric pressure.[2] The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum.","image":"Kolbenluftpumpe_hg.jpg.webp"}
