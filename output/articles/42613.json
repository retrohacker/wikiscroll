{"title":"Substitute good","summary":"In microeconomics, two goods are substitutes if the products could be used for the same purpose by the consumers.[1] That is, a consumer perceives both goods as similar or comparable, so that having more of one good causes the consumer to desire less of the other good. Contrary to complementary goods and independent goods, substitute goods may replace each other in use due to changing economic conditions.[2] An example of substitute goods is Coca-Cola and Pepsi; the interchangeable aspect of these goods is due to the similarity of the purpose they serve, i.e fulfilling customers' desire for a soft drink. These types of substitutes can be referred to as close substitutes.[3]","image":"Cross_elasticity_of_demand_substitutes_xi_xj.svg.png.webp"}
