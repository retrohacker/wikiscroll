{"title":"Nitro compound","summary":"Nitro compounds are organic compounds that contain one or more nitro functional groups (−NO2). The nitro group is one of the most common explosophores (functional group that makes a compound explosive) used globally. The nitro group is also strongly electron-withdrawing. Because of this property, C−H bonds alpha (adjacent) to the nitro group can be acidic. For similar reasons, the presence of nitro groups in aromatic compounds retards electrophilic aromatic substitution but facilitates nucleophilic aromatic substitution.  Nitro groups are rarely found in nature. They are almost invariably produced by nitration reactions starting with nitric acid.[1]","image":"Nitro-group-2D.png.webp"}
