{"title":"WHOIS","summary":"WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase \"who is\") is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format.[1] The current iteration of the WHOIS protocol was drafted by the Internet Society, and is documented in RFC 3912.","image":"Whois_Mushoku_Tensei_screenshot.png.webp"}
