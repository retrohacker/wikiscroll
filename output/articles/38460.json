{"title":"Ronald Fisher","summary":"Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS[5] (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was a British polymath who was active as a mathematician, statistician, geneticist, and academic.[6] For his work in statistics, he has been described as \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\"[7] and \"the single most important figure in 20th century statistics\".[8] In genetics, his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; this contributed to the revival of Darwinism in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis. For his contributions to biology, Fisher has been called \"the greatest of Darwin’s successors\".[9]","image":"Youngronaldfisher2.JPG.webp","url":"Ronald_Fisher"}
