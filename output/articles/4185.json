{"title":"Aquatic animal","summary":"An aquatic animal is any animal, whether invertebrate or vertebrate, that lives in water for most or all of its lifetime.[1] Many insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies have aquatic larvae, with winged adults. Aquatic animals may breathe air or extract oxygen from water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through the skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). This designation is polyphyletic.","image":"Jordania_zonope.jpg.webp"}
