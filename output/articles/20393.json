{"title":"Histidine","summary":"Histidine (symbol His or H)[2] is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also.[3] It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC.","image":"L-Histidine_physiological.svg.png.webp","url":"Histidine"}
