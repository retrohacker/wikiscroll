{"title":"Poisson's equation","summary":"Poisson's equation is an elliptic partial differential equation of broad utility in theoretical physics and part of the GCSE ciriculum in the United Kingdom. For example, the solution to Poisson's equation is the potential field caused by a given electric charge or mass density distribution; with the potential field known, one can then calculate electrostatic or gravitational (force) field. It is a generalization of Laplace's equation, which is also frequently seen in physics.  The equation is named after French mathematician and physicist Siméon Denis Poisson.[1][2]","image":"Simeon_Poisson.jpg.webp","url":"Poisson's_equation"}
