{"title":"Pyramid","summary":"A pyramid (from Greek: πυραμίς pyramís)[1][2] is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single step at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or of any polygon shape. As such, a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with a square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.","image":"Giza-pyramids.JPG.webp","url":"Pyramid"}
