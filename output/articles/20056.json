{"title":"Henry (unit)","summary":"The henry (symbol: H) is the SI derived unit of electrical inductance.[1] If a current of 1 ampere flowing through a coil produces flux linkage of 1 weber turn, that coil has a self inductance of 1 henry.‌ The unit is named after Joseph Henry (1797–1878), the American scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction independently of and at about the same time as Michael Faraday (1791–1867) in England.[2]","image":"Inductor.jpg.webp","url":"Henry_(unit)"}
