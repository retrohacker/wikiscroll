{"title":"Tobacco mosaic virus","summary":"Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus species in the genus Tobamovirus that infects a wide range of plants, especially tobacco and other members of the family Solanaceae.  The infection causes characteristic patterns, such as \"mosaic\"-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves (hence the name). TMV was the first virus to be discovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that a non-bacterial infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus. It is the first pathogen identified as a virus. Virus was crystallised by W.M.Stanley.","image":"TobaccoMosaicVirus.jpg.webp","url":"Tobacco_mosaic_virus"}
