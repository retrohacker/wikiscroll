{"title":"Noun","summary":"A noun (from Latin  nōmen 'name')[1] is a word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.[2][note 1] However, noun is not a semantic category, so it cannot be characterized in terms of its meaning. Thus, actions and states of existence can also be expressed by verbs, qualities by adjectives, and places by adverbs. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.[3] Many different types of nouns exist, including proper and common nouns, collective nouns, mass nouns, and so forth.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
