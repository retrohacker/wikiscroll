{"title":"Genetically modified food","summary":"Genetically modified foods (GM foods), also known as genetically engineered foods (GE foods), or bioengineered foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as selective breeding and mutation breeding.[1]","image":"Genetic_engineering_logo.png.webp","url":"Genetically_modified_food"}
