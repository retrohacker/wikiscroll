{"title":"Pinochle","summary":"Pinochle (English:  /ˈpiːnʌkəl/), also called pinocle or penuchle,[1] is a trick-taking, Ace-Ten card game typically for two to four players and played with a 48-card deck. It is derived from the card game bezique; players score points by trick-taking and also by forming combinations of cards into melds. It is thus considered part of a \"trick-and-meld\" category which also includes the game belote. Each hand is played in three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks. The standard game today is called \"partnership auction pinochle\".","image":"Pinochle2.svg.png.webp"}
