{"title":"Sweatshop","summary":"A sweatshop or sweat factory is a crowded[1] workplace with very poor, socially unacceptable or illegal working conditions. Some illegal working conditions include poor ventilation, little to no breaks, inadequate work space, insufficient lighting, or uncomfortably high temperatures. The work may be difficult, tiresome, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with unfair wages, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a minimum wage; child labor laws may also be violated. Women make up 85 to 90% of sweatshop workers and would be forced by employers to take birth control and routine pregnancy tests to avoid supporting maternity leave or providing health benefits.[2] The Fair Labor Association's \"2006 Annual Public Report\" inspected factories for FLA compliance in 18 countries including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, China, India, Vietnam, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and the US.[3] The U.S. Department of Labor's \"2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor\" found that \"18 countries did not meet the International Labour Organization's recommendation for an adequate number of inspectors.\"[4]","image":"Sweatshop-1890.jpg.webp"}
