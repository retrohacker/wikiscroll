{"title":"Robert Frank","summary":"Robert Frank (November 9, 1924 – September 9, 2019) was a Swiss photographer and documentary filmmaker, who became an American binational. His most notable work, the 1958 book titled The Americans, earned Frank comparisons to a modern-day de Tocqueville for his fresh and nuanced outsider's view of American society. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian in 2014, said The Americans \"changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it. [ ... ] it remains perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century.\"[1] Frank later expanded into film and video and experimented with manipulating photographs and photomontage.[2]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Robert_Frank"}
