{"title":"Damages","summary":"At common law, damages are a remedy in the form of a monetary award to be paid to a claimant as compensation for loss or injury.[1][2] To warrant the award, the claimant must show that a breach of duty has caused foreseeable loss. To be recognised at law, the loss must involve damage to property, or mental or physical injury; pure economic loss is rarely recognised for the award of damages.[3]","image":"Johnny-automatic-scales-of-justice.svg.png.webp"}
