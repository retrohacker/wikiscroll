{"title":"Four color theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that no more than four colors are required to color the regions of any map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.  Adjacent means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a corner where three or more regions meet.[1] It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Initially, this proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand.[2] Since then the proof has gained wide acceptance, although some doubters remain.[3]","image":"Four_Colour_Map_Example.svg.png.webp","url":"Four_color_theorem"}
