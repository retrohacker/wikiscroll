{"title":"Sundering of the Elves","summary":"In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the Elves or Quendi  are a sundered (divided) people.  They awoke at Cuiviénen on the continent of Middle-earth, where they were divided into three tribes: Minyar (the Firsts), Tatyar (the Seconds) and Nelyar (the Thirds). After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to live with the Valar in Valinor, on Aman.  That summoning and the Great Journey that followed split the Elves into two main groups (and many minor ones), which were never fully reunited.","image":"Elvish_Migrations_and_Kindreds.svg.png.webp","url":"Sundering_of_the_Elves"}
