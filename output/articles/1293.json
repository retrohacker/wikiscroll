{"title":"Law of large numbers","summary":"In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.[1]","image":"Lawoflargenumbers.svg.png.webp"}
