{"title":"Distributed computing","summary":"Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system.[1] The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.[1] It deals with a central challenge that, when components of a system fails, it doesn't imply the entire system fails.[2] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.","image":"Distributed-parallel.svg.png.webp"}
