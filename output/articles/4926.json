{"title":"Augustin-Louis Cauchy","summary":"Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (/koʊˈʃiː/;[1] French: [oɡystɛ̃  lwi koʃi]; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer, and physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics, including mathematical analysis and continuum mechanics. He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.","image":"Augustin-Louis_Cauchy_1901.jpg.webp"}
