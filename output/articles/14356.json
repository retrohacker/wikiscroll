{"title":"Eir","summary":"In Norse mythology, Eir (Old Norse: [ˈɛir], \"protection, help, mercy\"[1]) is a goddess or valkyrie associated with medical skill. Eir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry, including a runic inscription from Bergen, Norway from around 1300. Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure, and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie. In addition, Eir has been theorized as a form of the goddess Frigg and has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia.","image":"Menglöð_and_Nine_Maidens_by_Froelich.jpg.webp"}
