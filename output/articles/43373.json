{"title":"Tangent space","summary":"In mathematics, the tangent space of a manifold generalizes to higher dimensions the notion of  tangent planes to surfaces in three  dimensions and tangent lines to curves in two dimensions. In the context of physics the  tangent space to a manifold at a point can be viewed as the space of possible velocities for a particle moving on the manifold.","image":"Image_Tangent-plane.svg.png.webp","url":"Tangent_space"}
