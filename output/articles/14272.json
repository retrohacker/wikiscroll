{"title":"Edward VI","summary":"Edward VI (12 October 1537 – 6 July 1553) was the King of England and Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death in 1553. He was crowned on 20 February at the age of nine.[1] Edward was the son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour and England's first monarch to be raised as a Protestant.[2] During his reign, the realm was governed by a regency council because he never reached maturity. The council was first led by his uncle Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1547–1549), and then by John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick (1550–1553), who from 1551 was Duke of Northumberland.","image":"Circle_of_William_Scrots_Edward_VI_of_England.jpg.webp","url":"Edward_VI"}
