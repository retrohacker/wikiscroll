{"title":"Patchwork","summary":"Patchwork or \"pieced work\" is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. The larger design is usually based on repeating patterns built up with different fabric shapes (which can be different colors). These shapes are carefully measured and cut, basic geometric shapes making them easy to piece together.","image":"N2_midnight_sun.jpg.webp"}
