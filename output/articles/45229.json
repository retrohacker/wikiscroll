{"title":"Timeline of the Arab–Israeli conflict","summary":"The Arab–Israeli conflict began in the 20th century, evolving from earlier Intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine. The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of Israel in 1948. The Arab–Israeli conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (intifadas).","image":"Weizmann_and_feisal_1918.jpg.webp"}
