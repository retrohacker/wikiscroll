{"title":"Acetate","summary":"An acetate /ˈæsɪteɪt/ is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with a base (e.g. alkaline, earthy, metallic, nonmetallic or radical base).  \"Acetate\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula C2H3O−2.  The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a positive ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \"acetates\" (hence, acetate of lead, acetate of aluminum, etc.).  The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding  salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CH3CO−2, or CH3COO−.","image":"Acetate-anion-3D-balls.png.webp"}
