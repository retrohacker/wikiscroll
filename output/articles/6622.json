{"title":"Binary relation","summary":"In mathematics, a binary relation associates elements of one set, called the domain, with elements of another set, called the codomain.[1]  A binary relation over sets X and Y is a new set of ordered pairs (x, y) consisting of elements x in X and y in Y.[2] It is a generalization of the more widely understood idea of a mathematical function, but with fewer restrictions. It encodes the common concept of relation: an element x is related to an element y, if and only if the pair (x, y) belongs to the set of ordered pairs that defines the binary relation. A binary relation is the most studied special case n = 2 of an n-ary relation over sets X1, ..., Xn, which is a subset of the Cartesian product X 1 × ⋯ × X n . {\\displaystyle X_{1}\\times \\cdots \\times X_{n}.} [2]","image":"2b9332eafc39443cb3785081f0d3e889b64b0961.svg","url":"Binary_relation"}
