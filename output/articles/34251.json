{"title":"Peace","summary":"Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties.  Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.","image":"Peace_dove_(3329620077).jpg.webp"}
