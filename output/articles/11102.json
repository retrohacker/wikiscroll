{"title":"Convex function","summary":"In mathematics, a real-valued function is called convex if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function does not lie below the graph between the two points. Equivalently, a function is convex if its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. A twice-differentiable function of a single variable is convex if and only if its second derivative is nonnegative on its entire domain.[1] Well-known examples of convex functions of a single variable include the quadratic function x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} and the exponential function e x {\\displaystyle e^{x}} .   In simple terms, a convex function refers to a function that is in the shape of a cup ∪ {\\displaystyle \\cup } , and a concave function is in the shape of a cap ∩ {\\displaystyle \\cap } .","image":"cf0bf28fd28f45d07e1ceb909ce333c18c558c93.svg","url":"Convex_function"}
