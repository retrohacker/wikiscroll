{"title":"Scheme (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a scheme is a mathematical structure that enlarges the notion of algebraic variety in several ways, such as taking account of multiplicities (the equations x = 0 and x2 = 0 define the same algebraic variety and different schemes) and allowing \"varieties\" defined over any commutative ring (for example, Fermat curves are defined over the integers).","image":"bcfd83dd18314f17f78a370c58d4521af3d3196c.svg","url":"Scheme_(mathematics)"}
