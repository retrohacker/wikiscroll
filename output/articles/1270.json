{"title":"Joule","summary":"The joule (/dʒaʊl, dʒuːl/ jowl, jool;[1][2][3] symbol: J) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units.[4] It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton-metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).[5][6][7]","image":"bd1d453102e8a2ed06a8b2667eaeb5f7acd6d846.svg","url":"A%2fJoule"}
