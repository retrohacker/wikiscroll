{"title":"Vocational school","summary":"A vocational school is a type of educational institution, which, depending on the country, may refer to either secondary or post-secondary education[1] designed to provide vocational education or technical skills required to complete the tasks of a particular and specific job. In the case of secondary education, these schools differ from academic high schools which usually prepare students who aim to pursue tertiary education, rather than enter directly into the workforce. With regard to post-secondary education, vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades,[2] rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\" as well as technical skills of their students.[3]","image":"Fsg_wickersdorf_tischlerei.jpg.webp","url":"Vocational_school"}
