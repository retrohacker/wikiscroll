{"title":"Fresnel equations","summary":"The Fresnel equations (or Fresnel coefficients) describe the reflection and transmission of light (or electromagnetic radiation in general) when incident on an interface between different optical media. They were deduced by Augustin-Jean Fresnel (/freɪˈnɛl/) who was the first to understand that light is a transverse wave, even though no one realized that the \"vibrations\" of the wave were electric and magnetic fields. For the first time, polarization could be understood quantitatively, as Fresnel's equations correctly predicted the differing behaviour of waves of the s and p polarizations incident upon a material interface.","image":"Partial_transmittance.gif"}
