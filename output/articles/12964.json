{"title":"Diffraction","summary":"Diffraction refers to various phenomena that occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening. It is defined as the bending of waves around  the corners of an obstacle or through an aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle/aperture. The diffracting object or aperture effectively becomes a secondary source of the propagating wave. Italian scientist Francesco Maria Grimaldi coined the word diffraction and was the first to record accurate observations of the phenomenon in 1660.[1][2]","image":"Single_Slit_Diffraction.svg.png.webp","url":"Diffraction"}
