{"title":"Chern class","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry, the Chern classes are characteristic classes associated with complex vector bundles. They have since found applications in physics, Calabi–Yau manifolds, string theory, Chern–Simons theory, knot theory, Gromov–Witten invariants, topological quantum field theory, the Chern theorem etc.","image":"b711408c4ef248563ebab8a86c8860d0b18239f8.svg","url":"Chern_class"}
