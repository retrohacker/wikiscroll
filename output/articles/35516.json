{"title":"Pope Gregory III","summary":"Pope Gregory III (Latin: Gregorius III; died 28 November 741) was the bishop of Rome from 11 February 731 to his death. His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by Byzantine iconoclasm and the advance of the Lombards, in which he invoked the intervention of Charles Martel, although ultimately in vain. He was the last pope to seek the consent of the Byzantine exarch of Ravenna for his election, and the last non-European pope until the election of Pope Francis on 13 March 2013.[2]","image":"Liutprand's_Italy.gif","url":"Pope_Gregory_III"}
