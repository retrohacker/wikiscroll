{"title":"Record label","summary":"A record label, or record company, is a brand or trademark of music recordings and music videos, or the company that owns it. Sometimes, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos, while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists (\"artists and repertoire\" or \"A&R\"), and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \"record label\", derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.[1] Within the mainstream music industry, recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and promote their singles on streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels also provide publicists, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.","image":"e5f363207502335338273013548e6ed8.png.webp"}
