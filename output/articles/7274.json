{"title":"Borosilicate glass","summary":"Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with silica and boron trioxide as the main glass-forming constituents. Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (≈3 × 10−6 K−1 at 20 °C), making them more resistant to thermal shock than any other common glass. Such glass is subjected to less thermal stress and can withstand temperature differentials without fracturing of about 165 °C (297 °F).[1] It is commonly used for the construction of reagent bottles and flasks as well as lighting, electronics and cookware.","image":"GlassGuitarSlide.jpg.webp"}
