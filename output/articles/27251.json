{"title":"London","summary":"London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[8] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][9][10] Since the 19th century,[11] \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which largely makes up Greater London,[13] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.[note 2][14] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.","image":"London_Montage_L.jpg.webp"}
