{"title":".NET Framework","summary":"The .NET Framework (pronounced as \"dot net\") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called \"managed code\". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.","image":".NET_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
