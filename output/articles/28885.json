{"title":"Mathematical logic","summary":"Mathematical logic is the study of logic within mathematics. Major subareas include model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory. Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power. However, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning or to establish foundations of mathematics.","image":"037b84dcf7eb85313f964632c939bce6464a657c.svg","url":"Mathematical_logic"}
