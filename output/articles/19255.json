{"title":"Göttingen Seven","summary":"The Göttingen Seven (German: Göttinger Sieben) were a group of seven liberal professors from Göttingen.[2] In 1837, they protested against the abolition or alteration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Hanover by its new ruler, King Ernest Augustus, and refused to swear an oath to the king.[3][4] The company of seven was led by historian Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann,[5] who himself was one of the key advocates of the unadulterated constitution. The other six were the Germanist brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (famed fairy tale and folk tale writers and storytellers, known together as the Brothers Grimm),[6] jurist Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht, historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and theologian and orientalist Heinrich Georg August Ewald.[1]","image":"Göttinger_Sieben.jpg.webp","url":"Göttingen_Seven"}
