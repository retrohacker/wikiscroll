{"title":"Radio broadcasting","summary":"Radio broadcasting is transmission of audio (sound), sometimes with related metadata, by radio waves intended to reach a wide audience.  In terrestrial radio broadcasting the radio waves are broadcast by a land-based radio station, while in satellite radio the radio waves are broadcast by a satellite in Earth orbit.  To receive the content the listener must have a broadcast radio receiver (radio).   Stations are often affiliated with a radio network which provides content in a common radio format, either in broadcast syndication or simulcast or both.  Radio stations broadcast with several different types of modulation:  AM radio stations transmit in AM (amplitude modulation), FM radio stations transmit in FM (frequency modulation), which are older analog audio standards, while newer digital radio stations transmit in several digital audio standards: DAB (digital audio broadcasting), HD radio,  DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale).  Television broadcasting is a separate service which also uses radio frequencies to broadcast television (video) signals.","image":"Long_wave_radio_station_002_Motala_Sweden.JPG.webp"}
