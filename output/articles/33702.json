{"title":"Paleo-Indians","summary":"Paleo-Indians, Paleoindians or Paleo-Americans, were the first peoples who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. The prefix \"paleo-\" comes from the Greek adjective palaios (παλαιός), meaning \"old\" or \"ancient\". The term \"Paleo-Indians\" applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term \"Paleolithic\".[1]","image":"Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg.webp"}
