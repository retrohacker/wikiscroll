{"title":"Collective farming","summary":"Collective farming and communal farming are various types of \"agricultural production in which multiple farmers run their holdings as a joint enterprise\".[1] There are two broad types of communal farms: agricultural cooperatives, in which member-owners jointly engage in farming activities as a collective, and state farms, which are owned and directly run by a centralized government. The process by which farmland is aggregated is called collectivization. In some countries (including the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc countries, China and Vietnam), there have been both state-run and cooperative-run variants. For example, the Soviet Union had both kolkhozy (cooperative-run farms) and sovkhozy (state-run farms).","image":"Drive_to_the_Collective_Farm.jpg.webp","url":"Collective_farming"}
