{"title":"Monty Python","summary":"Monty Python (also collectively known as the Pythons)[2][3] were a British surreal comedy troupe who created the sketch comedy television show Monty Python's Flying Circus, which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and influence, including touring stage shows, films, albums, books and musicals. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music.[4][5][6] Regarded as an enduring icon of 1970s pop culture, their sketch show has been referred to as being \"an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\".[7]","image":"Flyingcircus_2.jpg.webp","url":"Monty_Python"}
