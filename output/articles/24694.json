{"title":"Khanbaliq","summary":"Khanbaliq or Dadu of Yuan (Chinese: 元大都) was the winter capital[1] of the Yuan dynasty founded by Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing, also the capital of China today. It was located at the center of modern Beijing. The Secretariat (中書省) directly administered the Central Region (腹裏) of the Yuan Empire (comprising present-day Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and parts of Henan and Inner Mongolia) and dictated policies for the other provinces. Kublai and his successors also claimed supremacy over the entire Mongol Empire following the death of Möngke Khan (Kublai's brother and predecessor) in 1259. Over time the unified empire gradually fragmented into a number of khanates.","image":"Map_of_Cambaluk.jpg.webp"}
