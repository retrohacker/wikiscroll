{"title":"Time-division multiplexing","summary":"Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line so that each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating pattern.  This method transmits two or more digital signals or analog signals over a common channel.  It can be used when the bit rate of the transmission medium exceeds that of the signal to be transmitted.  This form of signal multiplexing was developed in telecommunications for telegraphy systems in the late 19th century, but found its most common application in digital telephony in the second half of the 20th century.","image":"Multiplexing_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Time-division_multiplexing"}
