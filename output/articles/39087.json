{"title":"Salami","summary":"Salami (/səˈlɑːmi/ sə-LAH-mee) is a cured sausage consisting of fermented and air-dried meat, typically pork. Historically, salami was popular among Southern, Eastern, and Central European peasants because it can be stored at room temperature for up to 40 days once cut, supplementing a potentially meager or inconsistent supply of fresh meat. Countries and regions across Europe make their own traditional varieties of salami.","image":"Salami_aka.jpg.webp"}
