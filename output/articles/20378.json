{"title":"Hipster (contemporary subculture)","summary":"The 21st-century hipster is a subculture (sometimes called hipsterism)[1][2] that is defined by claims to authenticity and uniqueness yet, ironically, is notably lacking in authenticity and conforms to a collective style. The subculture embodies a particular ethic of consumption that seeks to commodify the idea of rebellion or counterculture. Fashion is one of the major markers of hipster identity.[3][4][5] Members of the subculture typically do not self-identify as hipsters,[1] and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative for someone who is pretentious or overly concerned with appearing trendy or fashionable in a non-mainstream way.[6]","image":"Craig_McMorris_(2011).jpg.webp","url":"Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)"}
