{"title":"Algebraic geometry","summary":"Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving  geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.","image":"Togliatti_surface.png.webp","url":"Algebraic_geometry"}
