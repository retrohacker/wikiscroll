{"title":"Island Records","summary":"Island Records is a multinational record label owned by Universal Music Group. It was founded in 1959 by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall, and Leslie Kong in Jamaica,[1] and was eventually sold to PolyGram in 1989. Island and A&M Records, another label recently acquired by PolyGram, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island  having exerted a major influence on the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s. Island Records operates four international divisions: Island US, Island UK, Island Australia, and Island France (known as Vertigo France until 2014). Current key people include Island US president Darcus Beese, OBE[2] and MD Jon Turner. Partially due to its significant legacy, Island remains one of UMG's pre-eminent record labels.","image":"IslandRecords.svg.png.webp","url":"Island_Records"}
