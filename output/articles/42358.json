{"title":"Stochastic","summary":"Stochastic (from Greek  στόχος (stókhos) 'aim, guess'[1]) refers to the property of being well described by a random probability distribution.[1] Although stochasticity and randomness are distinct in that the former refers to a modeling approach and the latter refers to phenomena themselves, these two terms are often used synonymously. Furthermore, in probability theory, the formal concept of a stochastic process is also referred to as a random process.[2][3][4][5][6]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Stochastic"}
