{"title":"Quechuan languages","summary":"Quechua (/ˈkɛtʃuə/,[1][2] US also /ˈkɛtʃwɑː/;[3] Spanish: [ˈketʃwa]), usually called Runasimi (\"people's language\") in Quechuan languages, is an indigenous language family spoken by the Quechua peoples, primarily living in the Peruvian Andes.[4] Derived from a common ancestral language, it is the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas, with an estimated 8–10 million speakers as of 2004.[5] Approximately 25% (7.7 million) of Peruvians speak a Quechuan language.[6][7]\nIt is perhaps most widely known for being the main language family of the Inca Empire. The Spaniards encouraged its use until the Peruvian struggle for independence of the 1780s. As a result, Quechua variants are still widely spoken today, being the co-official language of many regions and the second most spoken language family in Peru.","image":"Quechuan_distribution_(w_Inca_Empire).svg.png.webp"}
