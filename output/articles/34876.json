{"title":"Photoreceptor cell","summary":"A photoreceptor cell is a specialized type of neuroepithelial cell  found in the retina that is capable of visual phototransduction. The great biological importance of photoreceptors is that they convert light (visible electromagnetic radiation) into signals that can stimulate biological processes. To be more specific, photoreceptor proteins in the cell absorb photons, triggering a change in the cell's membrane potential.","image":"1414_Rods_and_Cones.jpg.webp","url":"Photoreceptor_cell"}
