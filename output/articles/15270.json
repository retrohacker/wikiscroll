{"title":"Euclidean vector","summary":"In mathematics, physics and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector[1] or spatial vector[2]) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction. Vectors can be added to other vectors according to vector algebra. A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a ray (a directed line segment), or graphically as an arrow connecting an initial point A with a terminal point B,[3] and denoted by A B → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {AB}}} .","image":"b245e60e48c3c8f577aaf9512a1bdf3049cc6207.svg","url":"Euclidean_vector"}
