{"title":"Venus flytrap","summary":"The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina.[3] It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs (called \"trigger hairs\" or \"sensitive hairs\") on their inner surfaces.","image":"Venus_Flytrap_showing_trigger_hairs.jpg.webp","url":"Venus_flytrap"}
