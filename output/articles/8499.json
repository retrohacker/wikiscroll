{"title":"Capoeira","summary":"Capoeira (Portuguese pronunciation: [kapuˈe(j)ɾɐ] or [kaˈpwɐjɾɐ]) is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance,[1][2][3] acrobatics,[4] and music.[5][6][7] It was practiced by enslaved Africans in Brazil[8] at the beginning of the 16th century.[9] It is known for its acrobatic and complex maneuvers, often involving hands on the ground and inverted kicks. It emphasizes flowing movements rather than fixed stances; the ginga, a rocking step, is usually the focal point of the technique. The most widely accepted origin of the word capoeira comes from the Tupi words ka'a (\"forest\") paũ (\"round\"),[10] referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior where fugitive slaves would hide. A practitioner of the art is called a capoeirista (Portuguese pronunciation: [kapue(j)ˈɾistɐ]).[11][12]","image":"Rugendasroda.jpg.webp"}
