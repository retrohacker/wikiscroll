{"title":"32-bit computing","summary":"In computer architecture, 32-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are  32 bits (4 octets) wide.  Also, 32-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 32-bit microcomputers are computers in which 32-bit microprocessors are the norm.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
