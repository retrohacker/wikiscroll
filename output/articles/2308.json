{"title":"Affidavit","summary":"An affidavit (/ˌæfəˈdeɪvət/ (listen) AF-ə-DAY-vət; Medieval Latin for \"he has declared under oath\") is a written statement voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath or affirmation which is administered by a person who is authorized to do so by law. Such a statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's signature by a taker of oaths, such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths. An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, which means that it is made under oath on penalty of perjury, and this serves as evidence for its veracity and is required in court proceedings.","image":"Vasil_Levski's_Affidavit.jpg.webp","url":"Affidavit"}
