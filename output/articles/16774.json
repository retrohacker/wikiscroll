{"title":"Fourth wall","summary":"The fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible, imagined wall separates actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this \"wall\", the convention assumes the actors act as if they cannot. From the 16th century onward, the rise of illusionism in staging practices, which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century, led to the development of the fourth wall concept.[1][2]","image":"The_Cherry_Orchard_MAT.jpg.webp"}
