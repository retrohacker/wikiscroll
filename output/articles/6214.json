{"title":"Benford's law","summary":"Benford's law, also known as the Newcomb–Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small.[1] In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30 % of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5 % of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1 % of the time.[2] Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.","image":"Rozklad_benforda.svg.png.webp","url":"Benford's_law"}
