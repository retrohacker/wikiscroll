{"title":"Piemonte (wine)","summary":"Piemonte wine is the range of Italian wines made in the region of Piedmont in the northwestern corner of Italy. \nThe best-known wines from the region include Barolo and Barbaresco. They are made from the Nebbiolo grape. These wines are ideal for storage and a well-aged Barolo for instance may leave a feeling of drinking velvet because the tannins are polished and integrated more and more into the wine. As the wine matures the colour becomes more brownish and rust-red.","image":"Piedmont_in_Italy.svg.png.webp"}
