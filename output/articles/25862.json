{"title":"Len Hutton","summary":"Sir Leonard Hutton (23 June 1916 – 6 September 1990) was an English cricketer.  He played as an opening batsman for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1934 to 1955 and for England in 79 Test matches between 1937 and 1955.  Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described him as \"one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket\".  He set a record in 1938 for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 runs against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years (and remains an England Test record).  Following the Second World War, he was the mainstay of England's batting.  In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th Century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won the Ashes the following year for the first time in 19 years.","image":"Len_Hutton_c1938.jpg.webp"}
