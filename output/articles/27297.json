{"title":"Long-term memory","summary":"Long-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model in which  informative knowledge is held indefinitely. It is defined in contrast to short-term and working memory, which persist for only about 18 to 30 seconds. Long-term memory is commonly labelled as explicit memory (declarative), as well as episodic memory, semantic memory, autobiographical memory, and implicit memory (procedural memory).","image":"Psi2.svg.png.webp"}
