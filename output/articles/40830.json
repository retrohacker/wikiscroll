{"title":"Sioux","summary":"The Sioux or Oceti Sakowin (/suː/; Dakota: Očhéthi Šakówiŋ /otʃʰeːtʰi ʃakoːwĩ/) are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America.  The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota and Lakota; collectively they are known as the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ (\"Seven Council Fires\"). The term \"Sioux\" is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Ojibwe term \"Nadouessioux\", and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects.","image":"En-chief-sitting-bull.jpg.webp"}
