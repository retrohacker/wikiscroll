{"title":"Winding number","summary":"In mathematics, the winding number or winding index of a closed curve in the plane around a given point is an integer representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point.  The winding number depends on the orientation of the curve, and it is negative if the curve travels around the point clockwise.","image":"Winding_Number_Around_Point.svg.png.webp"}
