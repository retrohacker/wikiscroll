{"title":"Geomorphology","summary":"Geomorphology (from Ancient Greek: γῆ, gê, \"earth\"; μορφή, morphḗ, \"form\"; and λόγος, lógos, \"study\") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of topographic and bathymetric features created by physical, chemical or biological processes operating at or near the Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform and terrain history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and numerical modeling. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as physical geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archaeology, climatology and geotechnical engineering. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.","image":"Badlands_at_the_Blue_Gate%2C_Utah.JPG.webp"}
