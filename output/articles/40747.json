{"title":"Simple linear regression","summary":"In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.[1][2][3][4][5] That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Simple_linear_regression"}
