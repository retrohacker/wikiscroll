{"title":"Text-based user interface","summary":"In computing, text-based user interfaces (TUI) (alternately terminal user interfaces, to reflect a dependence upon the properties of computer terminals and not just text), is a retronym describing a type of user interface (UI) common as an early form of human–computer interaction, before the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like GUIs, they may use the entire screen area and accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using special graphical characters such as ┌ and ╣, referred to in Unicode as the \"box drawing\" set. The modern context of use is usually a terminal emulator.","image":"Midnight_Commander_(2005)_en.png.webp","url":"Text-based_user_interface"}
