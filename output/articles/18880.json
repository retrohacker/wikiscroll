{"title":"Greedy algorithm","summary":"A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.[1] In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.","image":"Greedy_algorithm_36_cents.svg.png.webp","url":"Greedy_algorithm"}
