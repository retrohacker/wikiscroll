German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"[1][note 1] Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects made out of integers (for example, rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).","image":"Spirale_Ulam_150.jpg.webp"}
