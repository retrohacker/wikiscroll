{"title":"Bytecode","summary":"Bytecode, also termed p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable[1] source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Bytecode"}
