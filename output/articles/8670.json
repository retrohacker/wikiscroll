{"title":"Carlos Valderrama","summary":"Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio (Colombian Spanish: [ˈkaɾlos alˈβeɾto βaldeˈrama paˈlasjo]; born 2 September 1961), also known as El Pibe (\"The Kid\"),[2] is a Colombian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. A creative playmaker, he is regarded as one of the best Colombian footballers of all time, and by some as Colombia's greatest player ever. His distinctive hairstyle, as well as his precise passing and technical skills made him one of South America's most recognisable footballers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He won the South American Footballer of the Year award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by World Soccer. In 2004, he was included in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 \"greatest living footballers\" chosen by Pelé to celebrate the 100th anniversary of FIFA.[3][4][5][6][7][8]","image":"Valderrama2010_(cropped).JPG.webp","url":"Carlos_Valderrama"}
