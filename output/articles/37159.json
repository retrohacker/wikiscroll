{"title":"Raphael (archangel)","summary":"Raphael (/ˈræfiəl/; Hebrew: רֵפָאֵל‎, translit. Rəp̄āʾēl, lit. 'God has healed'; Ancient Greek: Ραφαήλ, Raphaḗl; Coptic: ⲣⲁⲫⲁⲏⲗ, Rafaêl; Arabic: رافائيل‎, Rafā’īl, or إسرافيل, Isrāfīl; Amharic: ሩፋኤል, Rufaʾel) is an archangel mentioned in the Book of Tobit and in 1 Enoch, both dating from the last few centuries before Christ.[2][3] In later Jewish tradition, he became identified as one of the three heavenly visitors entertained by Abraham at the Oak of Mamre. He is not named in either the Christian New Testament or the Quran, but later Christian tradition identified him with healing and as the angel who stirred waters in the Pool of Bethesda in John 5:2-4.[2] In Islam, where his name is Israfil, he is understood to be the unnamed angel of Quran 6:73, who stands eternally with a trumpet to his lips, ready to announce the Day of Resurrection.","image":"Saint_Raphael.JPG.webp","url":"Raphael_(archangel)"}
