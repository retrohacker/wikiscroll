{"title":"Software design pattern","summary":"In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
