{"title":"Alkyne","summary":"In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon—carbon triple bond.[1] The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula  CnH2n-2. Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name acetylene also refers specifically to C2H2, known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic.[2]","image":"Acetylene-3D-vdW.png.webp"}
