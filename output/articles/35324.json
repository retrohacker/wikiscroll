{"title":"Poisson distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution (/ˈpwɑːsɒn/; French pronunciation: ​[pwasɔ̃]), named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.[1] The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.","image":"Poisson_pmf.svg.png.webp","url":"Poisson_distribution"}
