{"title":"Carpet shark","summary":"Carpet sharks are sharks classified in the order Orectolobiformes /ɒrɛkˈtɒləbɪfɔːrmiːz/. Sometimes the common name \"carpet shark\" (named so because many species resemble ornately patterned carpets) is used interchangeably with \"wobbegong\", which is the common name of sharks in the family Orectolobidae. Carpet sharks have five gill slits, two spineless dorsal fins, and a small mouth that does not extend past the eyes. Many species have barbels.","image":"Whale_shark_Georgia_aquarium.jpg.webp"}
