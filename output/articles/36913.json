{"title":"Racing flags","summary":"Racing flags[1] are traditionally used in auto racing and similar motorsports to indicate track condition and to communicate important messages to drivers. Typically, the starter, sometimes the grand marshal of a race, waves the flags atop a flag stand near the start/finish line. Track marshals are also stationed at observation posts along the race track in order to communicate both local and course-wide conditions to drivers.  Alternatively, some race tracks employ lights to supplement the primary flag at the start/finish line.","image":"RacingFlagsJune2007.jpg.webp"}
