{"title":"Computational complexity","summary":"In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to time and memory requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.","image":"6b04f5c5cfea38f43406d9442387ad28555e2609.svg","url":"Computational_complexity"}
