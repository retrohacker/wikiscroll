{"title":"Group theory","summary":"In mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups.  \nThe concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.","image":"Rubik's_cube.svg.png.webp"}
