{"title":"Typewriter","summary":"A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing characters. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on paper by striking an inked ribbon selectively against the paper with a type element.  At the end of the nineteenth century, the term 'typewriter' was also applied to a person who used such a device.[1]","image":"Underwoodfive.jpg.webp","url":"Typewriter"}
