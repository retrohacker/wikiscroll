{"title":"Hash function","summary":"A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.  The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.","image":"Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg.png.webp","url":"Hash_function"}
