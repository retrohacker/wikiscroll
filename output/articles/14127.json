Hungary has an export-oriented market economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade; thus the country is the 35th largest export economy in the world. The country had more than $100 billion of exports in 2015, with a high trade surplus of $9.003 billion, of which 79% went to the European Union (EU) and 21% was extra-EU trade.[29] Hungary's productive capacity is more than 80% privately owned, with 39.1% overall taxation, which funds the country's welfare economy. On the expenditure side, household consumption is the main component of GDP and accounts for 50% of its total, followed by gross fixed capital formation with 22% and government expenditure with 20%.[30] In 2009, Hungary, due to strong economic difficulties, had to request the help of the IMF for about €9 billion.[31][32][33]","image":"ING-Bank-szekhaz-P2030395-lev-1000.jpg.webp","url":"Economy_of_Hungary"}
