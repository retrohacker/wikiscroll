{"title":"Exterior algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} , denoted by u ∧ v {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v} , is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The magnitude[3] of u ∧ v {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v} can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} , which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. (Alternatively, it may be interpreted as the area of a triangle with sides u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} .) More generally, all parallel plane surfaces with the same orientation and area have the same bivector as a measure of their oriented area. Like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that u ∧ v = − ( v ∧ u ) {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v=-(v\\wedge u)} for all vectors u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} , but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is associative.","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg","url":"Exterior_algebra"}
