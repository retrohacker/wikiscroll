{"title":"Water polo","summary":"Water polo is a competitive team sport played in water between two teams of seven players each.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper. Excluding the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool so that players cannot touch the bottom.","image":"WaterPolo.JPG.webp"}
