{"title":"Fines herbes","summary":"Fines herbes (French: [fin.z‿ɛʁb]) designates an important combination of herbs that forms a mainstay of French cuisine.  The canonical fines herbes of French haute cuisine comprise finely chopped parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil. These are employed in seasoning delicate dishes, such as chicken, fish, and eggs, that need a relatively short cooking period; they may also be used in a beurre blanc sauce for seasoning such dishes. Fines herbes are also eaten raw in salads.","image":"Krause_Petersilie_dichtwachsend.JPG.webp","url":"Fines_herbes"}
