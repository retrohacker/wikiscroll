{"title":"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine","summary":"The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (also known as NASEM or the National Academies) is the collective scientific national academy of the United States. The name is used interchangeably in two senses: (1) as an umbrella term for its three quasi-independent honorific member organizations the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM); and (2) as the brand for studies and reports issued by the operating arm of the three academies, the National Research Council (NRC).  The NRC was first formed in 1916 as an activity of the NAS.  Now jointly governed by all three academies, it produces some 200 publications annually which are published by the National Academies Press.","image":"Keck_Center_of_the_National_Academies.JPG.webp"}
