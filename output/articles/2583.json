J. Foyt, himself, Rick Mears and Hélio Castroneves) to have won the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race four times (1970, 1971, 1978, 1987), the fourth of five to have won the race in consecutive years, and won the National Championship in 1970, 1983, and 1985. The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times. He is the only person to have both a sibling (Bobby) and child (Al Jr.) as fellow Indy 500 winners (coincidentally, all three captured their final Indy 500 wins racing for Team Penske). Al's nephews Johnny and Robby Unser have also competed in that race.","image":"Al_Unser_2021_(51223178438)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
