{"title":"IPv6","summary":"Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.[1] In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,[2] who subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.[3][4]","image":"IPv6_header-en.svg.png.webp"}
