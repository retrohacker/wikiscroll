{"title":"Non-player character","summary":"A non-player character (NPC) is any character in a game that is not controlled by a player.[1] The term originated in traditional tabletop role-playing games where it applies to characters controlled by the gamemaster or referee rather than by another player. In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer (instead of the player) that has a predetermined set of behaviors that potentially will impact gameplay, but will not necessarily be the product of true artificial intelligence.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Non-player_character"}
