{"title":"Imaginary number","summary":"An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i,[note 1] which is defined by its property i2 = −1.[1][2] The square of an imaginary number bi is −b2. For example, 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is −25. By definition, zero is considered to be both real and imaginary.[3]","image":"Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png.webp","url":"Imaginary_number"}
