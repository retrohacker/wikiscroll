{"title":"Quantum field theory","summary":"In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity and quantum mechanics.[1]: xi  QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles.","image":"Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png.webp"}
