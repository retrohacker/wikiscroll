One of the black basses, it is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking—as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States.[4] The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches and 12 pounds.  The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin.[5] The world record size was 11 lbs and 15 ounces caught in the reservoir Dale Hollow, on the Kentucky—Tennessee border.[6] Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.","image":"Range_map.jpg.webp"}
