{"title":"Finitary relation","summary":"In mathematics, a finitary relation over sets X1, …, Xn is a subset of the Cartesian product X1 × ⋯ × Xn; that is, it is a set of n-tuples (x1, …, xn) consisting of elements xi in Xi.[1][2][3] Typically, the relation describes a possible connection between the elements of an n-tuple. For example, the relation \"x is divisible by y and z\" consists of the set of 3-tuples such that when substituted to x, y and z, respectively, make the sentence true.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
