{"title":"Noether's theorem","summary":"Noether's theorem or Noether's first theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system with conservative forces has a corresponding conservation law.[1] The theorem was proven by mathematician Emmy Noether in 1915 and published in 1918,[2] after a special case was proven by E. Cosserat and F. Cosserat in 1909.[3] The action of a physical system is the integral over time of a Lagrangian function, from which the system's behavior can be determined by the principle of least action. This theorem only applies to continuous and smooth symmetries over physical space.","image":"Noether_theorem_1st_page.png.webp","url":"Noether's_theorem"}
