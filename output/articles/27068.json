{"title":"Literary criticism","summary":"Literary criticism (or literary studies) is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of literature's goals and methods. Though the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists.","image":"Liji2_no_bg.png.webp","url":"Literary_criticism"}
