{"title":"Cloud computing","summary":"Cloud computing[1] is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2] Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence  and economies of scale, typically using a \"pay-as-you-go\" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.[3]","image":"Cloud_computing.svg.png.webp"}
