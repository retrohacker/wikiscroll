{"title":"Vibration","summary":"Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point. The word comes from Latin vibrationem (\"shaking, brandishing\"). The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a pendulum—or random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Vibration"}
