{"title":"Welsh National Opera","summary":"Welsh National Opera (WNO) (Welsh: Opera Cenedlaethol Cymru) is an opera company based in Cardiff, Wales; it gave its first performances in 1946. It began as a mainly amateur body and transformed into an all-professional ensemble by 1973. In its early days the company gave a single week's annual season in Cardiff, gradually extending its schedule to become an all-year-round operation, with its own salaried chorus and orchestra. It has been described by The New York Times as \"one of the finest operatic ensembles in Europe\".[1]","image":"WNO_logo.png.webp","url":"Welsh_National_Opera"}
