{"title":"This Is What the Truth Feels Like","summary":"This Is What the Truth Feels Like is the third studio album by American singer Gwen Stefani. It was released on March 18, 2016, by Interscope Records. Initially, the album was scheduled to be released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.","image":"Gwen_Stefani_-_This_Is_What_the_Truth_Feels_Like_(Official_Album_Cover).png.webp","url":"This_Is_What_the_Truth_Feels_Like"}
