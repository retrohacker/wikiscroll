{"title":"Coprime integers","summary":"In mathematics, two integers a and b are coprime, relatively prime or mutually prime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is 1.[1] Consequently, any prime number that divides a does not divide b, and vice versa. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor (gcd) being 1.[2] One says also a is prime to b or a is coprime with b.","image":"32b55cea2fe988b733476e92cb40e44fb8b2a24d.svg"}
