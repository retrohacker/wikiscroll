{"title":"Optics","summary":"Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behaviour and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it.[1] Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.[1]","image":"Light_dispersion_of_a_mercury-vapor_lamp_with_a_flint_glass_prism_IPNr°0125.jpg.webp","url":"Optics"}
