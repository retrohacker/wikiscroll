{"title":"Mantle plume","summary":"A mantle plume is a proposed mechanism of convection within the Earth's mantle. Because the plume head partially melts on reaching shallow depths, a plume is often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots, such as Hawaii or Iceland, and large igneous provinces such as the Deccan and Siberian Traps. Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries, while others represent unusually large-volume volcanism near plate boundaries.","image":"Lower_Mantle_Superplume.PNG.webp","url":"Mantle_plume"}
