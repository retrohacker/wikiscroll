{"title":"Typesetting","summary":"Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical type[1] or its digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more fonts (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typefaces). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.[2]","image":"Metal_movable_type.jpg.webp","url":"Typesetting"}
