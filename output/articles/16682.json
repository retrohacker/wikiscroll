{"title":"Forging","summary":"Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces.  The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die.  Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons.[1][2] Forging has been done by smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve an almost finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.[3]","image":"Bochumer_Verein-03-50142.jpg.webp"}
