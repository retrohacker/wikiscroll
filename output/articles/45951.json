{"title":"Trie","summary":"In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a type of search tree, a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.","image":"Trie_example.svg.png.webp"}
