{"title":"Perturbation (astronomy)","summary":"In astronomy, perturbation is the complex motion of a massive body subject to forces other than the gravitational attraction of a single other massive body.[1] The other forces can include a third (fourth, fifth, etc.) body, resistance, as from an atmosphere, and the off-center attraction of an oblate or otherwise misshapen body.[2]","image":"Moon_perturbation_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
