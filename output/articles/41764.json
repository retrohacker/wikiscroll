{"title":"Spirit (rover)","summary":"Spirit, also known as MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover – A) or MER-2, is a Mars robotic rover, active from 2004 to 2010.[2] Spirit was operational on Mars for 2208 sols (2249 days; 6 years, 77 days). It was one of two rovers of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Spirit landed successfully within the impact crater Gusev on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), which landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. The rover stuck in a \"sand trap\" in late 2009 at an angle that hampered recharging of its batteries; its last communication with Earth was on March 22, 2010.","image":"KSC-03PD-0786.jpg.webp","url":"Spirit_(rover)"}
