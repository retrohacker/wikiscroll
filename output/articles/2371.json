Agadir is the capital of the Agadir Ida-U-Tanan Prefecture and of the Souss-Massa economic region. The majority of its inhabitants speak Berber, one of Morocco’s two official languages. It was the site of the 1911 Agadir Crisis that exposed tensions between France and Germany, foreshadowing World War I.","image":"Agadir-cityreflection.jpg.webp","url":"Agadir"}
