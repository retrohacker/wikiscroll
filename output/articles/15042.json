{"title":"Ergodicity","summary":"In mathematics, ergodicity expresses the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense. This implies that the average behavior of the system can be deduced from the trajectory of a \"typical\" point. Equivalently, a sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process.  Ergodicity is a property of the system; it is a statement that the system cannot be reduced or factored into smaller components. Ergodic theory is the study of systems possessing ergodicity.","image":"6dd519d79d32a219cd3d056263ec3094699f55a0.svg"}
