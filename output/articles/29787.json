{"title":"Microsoft Corp. v. Commission","summary":"Microsoft Corp. v. Commission (2007) T-201/04 is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Sun Microsystems over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player. The European Commission especially focused on the interoperability issue.[1]","image":"Belgique_-_Bruxelles_-_Schuman_-_Berlaymont_-_01.jpg.webp"}
