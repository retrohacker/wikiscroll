{"title":"British Board of Film Classification","summary":"The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC, previously the British Board of Film Censors) is a non-governmental organisation founded by the film industry in 1912 and responsible for the national classification and censorship of films exhibited at cinemas and video works (such as television programmes, trailers, adverts, public information/campaigning films, menus, bonus content, etc.) released on physical media within the United Kingdom.[1][2] It has a statutory requirement to classify all video works released on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray (including 3D and 4K UHD formats), and, to a lesser extent, some video games under the Video Recordings Act 1984.[3] The BBFC was also the designated regulator for the UK age-verification scheme which was abandoned before being implemented.[4][5]","image":"BBFC_logo_(new).svg.png.webp"}
