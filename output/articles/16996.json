{"title":"Freedman","summary":"A freedman or freedwoman is a formerly enslaved person who has been released from slavery, usually by legal means. Historically, enslaved people were freed by manumission (granted freedom by their captor-owners), emancipation (granted freedom as part of a larger group), or self-purchase. A fugitive slave is a person who escaped enslavement by fleeing.","image":"DM_Tiberius_Claudius_Chryseros.jpg.webp","url":"Freedman"}
