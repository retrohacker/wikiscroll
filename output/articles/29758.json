{"title":"Microbat","summary":"Microbats constitute the suborder Microchiroptera within the order Chiroptera (bats). Bats have long been differentiated into Megachiroptera (megabats) and Microchiroptera, based on their size, the use of echolocation by the Microchiroptera and other features; molecular evidence suggests a somewhat different subdivision, as the microbats have been shown to be a paraphyletic group.[1]","image":"Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg.webp","url":"Microbat"}
