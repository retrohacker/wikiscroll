{"title":"Ideogram","summary":"An ideogram or ideograph (from Greek ἰδέα idéa \"idea\" and γράφω gráphō \"to write\") is a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as pictograms.","image":"EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg.webp"}
