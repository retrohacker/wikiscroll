{"title":"Orientability","summary":"In mathematics, orientability is a property of some topological spaces such as real vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, surfaces, and more generally manifolds that allows a consistent definition of \"clockwise\" and \"counterclockwise\".[1] A space is orientable if such a consistent definition exists. In this case, there are two possible definitions, and a choice between them is an orientation of the space. Real vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, and spheres are orientable. A space is non-orientable if \"clockwise\" is changed into \"counterclockwise\" after running through some loops in it, and coming back to the starting point. This means that a geometric shape, such as , that moves continuously along such a loop is changed in its own mirror image . A Möbius strip is an example of a non-orientable space.","image":"Small_pie.svg.png.webp","url":"Orientability"}
