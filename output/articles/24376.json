{"title":"Karaoke","summary":"Karaoke (/ˌkærəˈoʊki/;[1] Japanese: [kaɾaoke] (listen); カラオケ, clipped compound of Japanese kara 空 \"empty\" and ōkesutora オーケストラ \"orchestra\") is a type of interactive entertainment usually offered in clubs and bars, where people sing along to recorded music using a microphone. The music is an instrumental version of a well-known popular song. Lyrics are usually displayed on a video screen, along with a moving symbol, changing colour, or music video images, to guide the singer. In Chinese-speaking countries and regions such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, a karaoke box is called a KTV. The global karaoke market has been estimated to be worth nearly $10 billion.[2]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
