{"title":"Toxicodendron radicans","summary":"Toxicodendron radicans, commonly known as eastern poison ivy[1] or poison ivy, is an allergenic Asian and Eastern North American flowering plant in the genus Toxicodendron. The species is well known for causing urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash, in most people who touch it. The rash is caused by urushiol, a clear liquid compound in the plant's sap.[2] The species is variable in its appearance and habit, and despite its common name, it is not a true ivy (Hedera), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae). T. radicans is commonly eaten by many animals, and the seeds are consumed by birds,[3] but poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome weed. It is a different species from western poison ivy, Toxicodendron rydbergii, which has similar effects.","image":"2014-10-29_13_43_39_Poison_Ivy_foliage_during_autumn_leaf_coloration_in_Ewing%2C_New_Jersey.JPG.webp","url":"Toxicodendron_radicans"}
