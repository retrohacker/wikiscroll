{"title":"Film","summary":"A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word \"cinema\", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.","image":"Muybridge_race_horse_animated.gif","url":"Film"}
