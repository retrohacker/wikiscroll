{"title":"Cytochrome","summary":"Cytochromes are redox-active proteins containing a heme, with a central Fe atom at its core, as a cofactor. They are involved in electron transport chain and redox catalysis. They are classified according to the type of heme and its mode of binding. Four varieties are recognized by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), cytochromes a, cytochromes b, cytochromes c and cytochrome d.[1]  Cytochrome function is linked to the reversible redox change from ferrous (Fe(II)) to the ferric (Fe(III)) oxidation state of the iron found in the heme core.[2]  In addition to the classification by the IUBMB into four cytochrome classes, several additional classifications such as cytochrome o[3] and cytochrome P450 can be found in biochemical literature.","image":"Cytochrome_c.png.webp","url":"Cytochrome"}
