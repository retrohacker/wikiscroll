{"title":"Public history","summary":"Public history is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the United States and Canada since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives,  film and television companies, new medias and all levels of government.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Public_history"}
