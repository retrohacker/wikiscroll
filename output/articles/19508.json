{"title":"Hammurabi","summary":"Hammurabi[lower-alpha 1] (c. 1810 – c. 1750 BC) was the sixth king of the First Babylonian dynasty of the Amorite tribe,[2] reigning from c. 1792 BC to c. 1750 BC (according to the Middle Chronology). He was preceded by his father, Sin-Muballit, who abdicated due to failing health. During his reign, he conquered Elam and the city-states of Larsa, Eshnunna, and Mari. He ousted Ishme-Dagan I, the king of Assyria, and forced his son Mut-Ashkur to pay tribute, bringing almost all of Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule.[3]","image":"F0182_Louvre_Code_Hammourabi_Bas-relief_Sb8_rwk.jpg.webp","url":"Hammurabi"}
