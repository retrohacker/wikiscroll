{"title":"Least common multiple","summary":"In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.[1][2]  Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero.[3]  However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.","image":"Symmetrical_5-set_Venn_diagram_LCM_2_3_4_5_7.svg.png.webp"}
