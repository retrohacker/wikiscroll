{"title":"Quantization (signal processing)","summary":"Quantization, in mathematics and digital signal processing, is the process of mapping input values from a large set (often a continuous set) to output values in a (countable) smaller set, often with a finite number of elements.  Rounding and truncation are typical examples of quantization processes.  Quantization is involved to some degree in nearly all digital signal processing, as the process of representing a signal in digital form ordinarily involves rounding.  Quantization also forms the core of essentially all lossy compression algorithms.","image":"Quantization_error.png.webp"}
