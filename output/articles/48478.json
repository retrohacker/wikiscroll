{"title":"Wilcoxon signed-rank test","summary":"The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used either to test the location of a set of samples or to compare the locations of two populations using a set of matched samples.[1] When applied to test the location of a set of samples, it serves the same purpose as the one-sample Student's t-test.[2] On a set of matched samples, it is a paired difference test like the paired Student's t-test (also known as the \"t-test for matched pairs\" or \"t-test for dependent samples\"). Unlike the Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test does not assume that the data is normally distributed.  On a wide variety of data sets, it has greater statistical power than the Student's t-test and is more likely to produce a statistically significant result. The cost of this applicability is that it has less statistical power than the Student's t-test when the data is normally distributed.","image":"271de587d12c2bd6cc92676dbbd7cc1af68a3629.svg","url":"Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test"}
