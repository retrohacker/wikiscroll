{"title":"Mīmāṃsā","summary":"Mīmāṁsā (Sanskrit: मीमांसा[1]) is a Sanskrit word that means \"reflection\" or \"critical investigation\" and thus refers to a tradition of contemplation which reflected on the meanings of certain Vedic texts.[2][3] This tradition is also known as Pūrva-Mīmāṁsā because of its focus on the earlier (pūrva) Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as Karma-Mīmāṁsā due to its focus on ritual action (karma).[4] It is one of six Vedic \"affirming\" (āstika) schools of Hinduism. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of dharma, based on hermeneutics of the Vedas, especially the Brāḥmanas and Saṃhitas.[5] The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the vedāntic schools, which were also known as Uttara-Mīmāṁsā for their focus on the \"later\" (uttara) portions of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads. While both \"earlier\" and \"later\" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.[6]","image":"Om_symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Mīmāṃsā"}
