{"title":"Systematics","summary":"Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies).  Phylogenies have two components: branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution).  Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.","image":"Phylogenetics.svg.png.webp"}
