{"title":"Molecular evolution","summary":"Molecular evolution is the process of change in the sequence composition of cellular molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins across generations. The field of  molecular evolution uses principles of evolutionary biology and population genetics to explain patterns in these changes.  Major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes, neutral evolution vs. natural selection, origins of new genes, the genetic nature of complex traits, the genetic basis of speciation, evolution of development, and ways that evolutionary forces influence genomic and phenotypic changes.","image":"Darwin's_finches_by_Gould.jpg.webp","url":"Molecular_evolution"}
