{"title":"Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy","summary":"The halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's breast—adorned with a nipple shield—was exposed by Justin Timberlake to the viewing public for approximately half a second. The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate or Janetgate, led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.","image":"Janet_Jackson_%26_Justin_Timberlake's_wardrobe_malfunction.jpg.webp"}
