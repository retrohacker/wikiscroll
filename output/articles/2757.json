{"title":"Aleutian Islands","summary":"The Aleutian Islands (/əˈluːʃən/;[2][3] Russian: Алеутские острова; Aleut: Unangam Tanaa, literally \"Land of the Aleuts\", possibly from Chukchi aliat, \"island\"), also called the Aleut Islands[4] or Aleutic Islands[5] and known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller islands. Most of the Aleutian Islands belong to the U.S. state of Alaska, but some belong to the Russian federal subject of Kamchatka Krai.[1] They form part of the Aleutian Arc in the Northern Pacific Ocean, occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666 km2) and extending about 1,200 mi (1,900 km) westward from the Alaska Peninsula toward the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and act as a border between the Bering Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Crossing longitude 180°, at which point east and west longitude end, the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the United States by longitude (Amatignak Island) and the easternmost by longitude (Semisopochnoi Island). The westernmost U.S. island in real terms, however, is Attu Island, west of which runs the International Date Line. While nearly all the archipelago is part of Alaska and is usually considered as being in the \"Alaskan Bush\", at the extreme western end, the small, geologically related Commander Islands belong to Russia.","image":"Aleutian_Islands%2C_outlined_in_red.png.webp"}
