{"title":"Division by zero","summary":"In mathematics, division by zero is division where the divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a 0 {\\textstyle {\\tfrac {a}{0}}} where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, when multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a ≠ 0 {\\textstyle a\\neq 0} ), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0 0 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {0}{0}}} is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a 0 {\\textstyle {\\tfrac {a}{0}}} is contained in Anglo-Irish philosopher George Berkeley’s criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in The Analyst (\"ghosts of departed quantities\").[1]","image":"2c72589e4be8713f9882fd9de07b5e4e19ec4f8a.svg","url":"Division_by_zero"}
