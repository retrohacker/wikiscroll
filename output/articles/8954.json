{"title":"Cauchy's integral theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cauchy integral theorem (also known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem) in complex analysis, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy (and Édouard Goursat), is an important statement about line integrals for holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Essentially, it says that if f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} is analytic in a simply connected domain Ω, then for any simply closed contour C {\\displaystyle C} in Ω, that contour integral is zero.","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg","url":"Cauchy's_integral_theorem"}
