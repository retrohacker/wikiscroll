{"title":"Strategic dominance","summary":"In game theory, strategic dominance (commonly called simply dominance) occurs when one strategy is better than another strategy for one player, no matter how that player's opponents may play.  Many simple games can be solved using dominance. The opposite, intransitivity, occurs in games where one strategy may be better or worse than another strategy for one player, depending on how the player's opponents may play.","image":"0f14de04ee675be80958307e46b611ae80a5f43e.svg","url":"Strategic_dominance"}
