{"title":"URL shortening","summary":"URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL \"https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/\" can be shortened to \"https://example.com/Foo\", and the URL \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening\" can be shortened to \"https://w.wiki/U\". Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one. A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message (for example SMS), for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, for making it easier for a person to remember, or for the intention of a permalink. In November 2009, the shortened links of the URL shortening service Bitly were accessed 2.1 billion times.[1]","image":"Screenshot_URL_shortener.png.webp","url":"URL_shortening"}
