{"title":"Cauchy sequence","summary":"In mathematics, a Cauchy sequence (French pronunciation: ​[koʃi]; English:  /ˈkoʊʃiː/ KOH-shee), named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.[1]  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.","image":"Cauchy_sequence_illustration.svg.png.webp","url":"Cauchy_sequence"}
