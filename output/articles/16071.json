{"title":"Fiber Distributed Data Interface","summary":"Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a standard for data transmission in a local area network. It uses optical fiber as its standard underlying physical medium, although it was also later specified to use copper cable, in which case it may be called CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface), standardized as TP-PMD (Twisted-Pair Physical Medium-Dependent), also referred to as TP-DDI (Twisted-Pair Distributed Data Interface).","image":"Sbus-das-fddi.jpg.webp","url":"Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface"}
