{"title":"Axiom of choice","summary":"In mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that a Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite. Formally, it states that for every indexed family ( S i ) i ∈ I {\\displaystyle (S_{i})_{i\\in I}} of nonempty sets there exists an indexed family ( x i ) i ∈ I {\\displaystyle (x_{i})_{i\\in I}} of elements such that x i ∈ S i {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in S_{i}} for every i ∈ I {\\displaystyle i\\in I} .  The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.[1]","image":"678af8cfde54ae12ee7322dcac4b969eae1b021a.svg","url":"Axiom_of_choice"}
