{"title":"Anaerobic organism","summary":"An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require molecular oxygen for growth. It may react negatively or even die if free oxygen is present. In contrast, an aerobic organism (aerobe) is an organism that requires an oxygenated environment.  Anaerobes may be unicellular (e.g. protozoans,[1] bacteria[2]) or multicellular.[3]\nMost fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. However, some species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are obligate anaerobes; for these species, anaerobic respiration is used because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. Deep waters of the ocean are a common anoxic environment. [3]","image":"Spinoloricus.png.webp"}
