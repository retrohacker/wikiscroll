{"title":"Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy","summary":"The fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, also known in Italy as 25 Luglio (Italian: Venticinque Luglio, pronounced [ˌventiˈtʃiŋkwe ˈluʎʎo]; lit. \"25 July\"), came as a result of parallel plots led respectively by Count Dino Grandi and King Victor Emmanuel III during the spring and summer of 1943, culminating with a successful vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister Benito Mussolini at the meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism on 24–25 July 1943. As a result, a new government was established, putting an end to the 21 years of Fascist rule in the Kingdom of Italy, and Mussolini was placed under arrest.[1][2][3][4]","image":"Benito_Mussolini_portrait_as_dictator_(retouched).jpg.webp","url":"Fall_of_the_Fascist_regime_in_Italy"}
