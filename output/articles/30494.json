{"title":"Moore's law","summary":"Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.","image":"Moore's_Law_Transistor_Count_1970-2020.png.webp"}
