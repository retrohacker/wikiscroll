{"title":"Nekton","summary":"Nekton or necton (from the Greek: νήκτον, translit. nekton, lit. \"to swim\") refers to the actively swimming aquatic organisms in a body of water. The term was proposed by German biologist Ernst Haeckel to differentiate between the active swimmers in a body of water, and the passive organisms that were carried along by the current, the plankton. As a guideline, nektonic organisms have a high Reynolds number (greater than 1000) and planktonic organisms a low one (less than 10). However, some organisms can begin life as plankton and transition to nekton later on in life, sometimes making distinction difficult when attempting to classify certain plankton-to-nekton species as one or the other. For this reason, some biologists choose not to use this term.","image":"Plankton%2C_Nekton%2C_Benthos.jpg.webp","url":"Nekton"}
