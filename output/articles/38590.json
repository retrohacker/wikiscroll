{"title":"Roy Bean","summary":"Phantly Roy Bean Jr. (c. 1825 – March 16, 1903) was an American saloon-keeper and Justice of the Peace in Val Verde County, Texas who called himself \"The Only Law West of the Pecos\". According to legend, he held court in his saloon along the Rio Grande on a desolate stretch of the Chihuahuan Desert of southwest Texas. After his death, Western films and books cast him as a hanging judge, although he is known to have sentenced only two men to hang, one of whom escaped.","image":"Phantly_Roy_Bean%2C_Jr._.jpg.webp"}
