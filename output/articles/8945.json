{"title":"Cato the Younger","summary":"Marcus Porcius Cato (/ˈkeɪtoʊ/; 95 BC – April 46 BC), also known as Cato of Utica (Latin: Cato Uticensis) or Cato the Younger (Cato Minor), was a conservative Roman senator in the period of the late republic. A noted orator and a follower of the Stoic philosophy, he is remembered for his stubbornness and tenacity (especially in his lengthy conflict with Julius Caesar), as well as his immunity to bribes, his moral integrity, and his famous distaste for the ubiquitous corruption of the period. His epithet \"the Younger\" distinguishes him from his great-grandfather, Cato the Elder.","image":"Cato_Volubilis_bronze_bust.jpg.webp"}
