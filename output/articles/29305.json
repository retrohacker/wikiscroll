{"title":"Memoir","summary":"A memoir (/ˈmɛm.wɑːr/;[1] from French  mémoire [me.mwaʁ], from Latin  memoria 'memory, remembrance') is any nonfiction narrative writing based in the author's personal memories.[2][3] The assertions made in the work are thus understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \"of a life\", while a memoir often tells the story of a particular event or time, such as touchstone moments and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a memoirist or a memorialist.","image":"Walden_Thoreau.jpg.webp","url":"Memoir"}
