{"title":"Quasar","summary":"A quasar (/ˈkweɪzɑːr/; also known as a quasi-stellar object, abbreviated QSO) is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), powered by a supermassive black hole, with mass ranging from millions to tens of billions times the mass of the Sun, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up because of friction and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than a galaxy such as the Milky Way.[2][3] Usually, quasars are categorized as a subclass of the more general category of AGN. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin.[4]","image":"Artist's_rendering_ULAS_J1120%2B0641.jpg.webp","url":"Quasar"}
