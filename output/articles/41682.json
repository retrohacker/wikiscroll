{"title":"Spectrum","summary":"A spectrum (plural spectra or spectrums)[1] is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without gaps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  It thereby became a mapping of a range of magnitudes (wavelengths) to a range of qualities, which are the perceived \"colors of the rainbow\" and other properties which correspond to wavelengths that lie outside of the visible light spectrum.","image":"Rainbow_above_Kaviskis_Lake%2C_Lithuania.jpg.webp"}
