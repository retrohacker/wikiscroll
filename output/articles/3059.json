{"title":"Alphabet","summary":"An alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes (called letters) that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages.[2] Not all writing systems represent language in this way; in a syllabary, each character represents a syllable, for instance, and logographic systems use characters to represent words, morphemes, or other semantic units.[3][4]","image":"Orbis_eruditi_literatura_à_charactere_Samaritico_deducta_1689.jpg.webp"}
