{"title":"Lie derivative","summary":"In differential geometry, the Lie derivative /ˈliː/, named after Sophus Lie by Władysław Ślebodziński,[1][2] evaluates the change of a tensor field (including scalar functions, vector fields and one-forms), along the flow defined by another vector field. This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any  differentiable manifold.","image":"872acd3d26631cf77c1e80331c77a30cfadda40e.svg","url":"Lie_derivative"}
