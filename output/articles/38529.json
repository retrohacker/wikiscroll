{"title":"Rosemary Clooney","summary":"Rosemary Clooney (May 23, 1928 – June 29, 2002) was an American singer and actress. She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the song \"Come On-a My House\", which was followed by other pop numbers such as \"Botch-a-Me\", \"Mambo Italiano\", \"Tenderly\", \"Half as Much\", \"Hey There\", and \"This Ole House\". She also had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly due to problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her White Christmas co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She continued recording until her death in 2002.","image":"Rosemary_Clooney_1954.jpg.webp","url":"Rosemary_Clooney"}
