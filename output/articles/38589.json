{"title":"Roy Acuff","summary":"Roy Claxton Acuff (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an American country music singer, fiddler, promoter, and freemason.[2] Known as the \"King of Country Music\", Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early string band and \"hoedown\" format to the singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952, Hank Williams told Ralph Gleason, \"He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God.\"[3]","image":"Roy_Acuff_1950.JPG.webp"}
