{"title":"Kangaroo rat","summary":"Kangaroo rats, small mostly nocturnal rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to arid areas of western North America. The common name derives from their bipedal form. They hop in a manner similar to the much larger kangaroo, but developed this mode of locomotion independently, like several other clades of rodents (e.g. dipodids and hopping mice).","image":"Kangaroo-rat.jpg.webp","url":"Kangaroo_rat"}
