{"title":"Sociocultural evolution","summary":"Sociocultural evolution, sociocultural evolutionism or cultural evolution are theories of sociobiology and cultural evolution that describe how societies and culture change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis).[1] Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\".[2]","image":"Portale_Leonardo_da_Vinci.png.webp"}
