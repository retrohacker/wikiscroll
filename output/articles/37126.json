{"title":"Random Access Memories","summary":"Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 through Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series. Recording took place at Henson, Conway and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Random Access Memories was the duo's final album before they split up in February 2021.","image":"Random_Access_Memories.jpg.webp"}
