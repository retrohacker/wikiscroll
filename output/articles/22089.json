{"title":"Integration by parts","summary":"In calculus, and more generally in mathematical analysis, integration by parts or partial integration is a process that finds the integral of a product of functions in terms of the integral of the product of their derivative and antiderivative. It is frequently used to transform the antiderivative of a product of functions into an antiderivative for which a solution can be more easily found. The rule can be thought of as an integral version of the product rule of differentiation.","image":"4a9092dcdbac9fb2a1a3f6337e5794f95e375219.svg","url":"Integration_by_parts"}
