It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal, bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx and containing in higher vertebrates the tongue and teeth.[2]  This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity, from the Latin bucca (\"cheek\").[3]","image":"Australien-Krokodil.JPG.webp","url":"Mouth"}
