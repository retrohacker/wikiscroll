{"title":"Exterior derivative","summary":"On a differentiable manifold, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function to differential forms of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.","image":"191277e0b4a0587a0d76e89fb02f5b15e6773552.svg"}
