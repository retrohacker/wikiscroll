{"title":"Philippine tarsier","summary":"The Philippine tarsier (Carlito syrichta), known locally as mawumag in Cebuano and other Visayan languages, and magô in Waray, is a species of tarsier endemic to the Philippines. It is found in the southeastern part of the archipelago, particularly on the islands of Bohol, Samar and Leyte.  It is a member of the approximately 45-million-year-old family Tarsiidae, whose name is derived from its elongated \"tarsus\" or ankle bone. Formerly a member of the genus Tarsius, it is now listed as the only member of the genus Carlito, a new genus named after the conservationist Carlito Pizarras.","image":"Tarsier-GG.jpg.webp"}
