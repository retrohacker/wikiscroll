{"title":"Green anaconda","summary":"The green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), also known as giant anaconda, common anaconda, common water boa or sucuri, is a boa species found in South America. It is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species. Like all boas, it is a non-venomous constrictor. The term \"anaconda\" often refers to this species, though the term could also apply to other members of the genus Eunectes. Fossils of the snake date back to the Late Pleistocene in the Gruta do Urso locality.[1]","image":"Anaconda_Loreto_Peru.jpg.webp","url":"Green_anaconda"}
