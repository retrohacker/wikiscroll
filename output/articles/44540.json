{"title":"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner","summary":"\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (originally \"The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere\") is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797–98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads. Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss.[1] Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.[2]","image":"Gustave_Dore_Ancient_Mariner_Illustration.jpg.webp"}
