{"title":"John I of Portugal","summary":"John I (Portuguese: João[1] [ʒuˈɐ̃w̃]; 11 April 1357 – 14 August 1433), also called John of Aviz, was King of Portugal from 1385 until his death in 1433. He is recognized chiefly for his role in Portugal's victory in a succession war with Castile, preserving his country's independence and establishing the Aviz (or Joanine) dynasty on the Portuguese throne. His long reign of 48 years, the most extensive of all Portuguese monarchs, saw the beginning of Portugal's overseas expansion.[2] John's well-remembered reign in his country earned him the epithet of Fond Memory (de Boa Memória); he was also referred to as \"the Good\" (o Bom), sometimes \"the Great\" (o Grande), and more rarely, especially in Spain, as \"the Bastard\" (Bastardo).","image":"Anoniem_-_Koning_Johan_I_van_Portugal_(1450-1500)_-_Lissabon_Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga_19-10-2010_16-12-61.jpg.webp"}
