{"title":"Sales tax","summary":"A sales tax is a tax paid to a governing body for the sales of certain goods and services. Usually laws allow the seller to collect funds for the tax from the consumer at the point of purchase. When a tax on goods or services is paid to a governing body directly by a consumer, it is usually called a use tax. Often laws provide for the exemption of certain goods or services from sales and use tax, such as food, education, and medicines. A value-added tax (VAT) collected on goods and services is related to a sales tax. See Comparison with sales tax for key differences.","image":"10_Percent_Legacy_and_Succession_Duty_Impressed_Duty_Stamp.svg.png.webp","url":"Sales_tax"}
