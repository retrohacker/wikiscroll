{"title":"Parity of zero","summary":"Zero is an even number. In other words, its parity—the quality of an integer being even or odd—is even. This can be easily verified based on the definition of \"even\": it is an integer multiple of 2, specifically 0 × 2. As a result, zero shares all the properties that characterize even numbers: for example, 0 is neighbored on both sides by odd numbers, any decimal integer has the same parity as its last digit—so, since 10 is even, 0 will be even, and if y is even then y + x has the same parity as x—and x and 0 + x always have the same parity.","image":"Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Parity_of_zero"}
