He was one of the first black performers in the United States to play onstage for white audiences and the only one of the era to tour with a white minstrel group. His real name was believed to be William Henry Lane,  and he was also known as \"Boz's Juba\" following Dickens's graphic description of him in American Notes.[1]","image":"Boz's_Juba_portrait.jpg.webp","url":"Master_Juba"}
