{"title":"Chinese remainder theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Chinese remainder theorem states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime.","image":"Sun_Tzu_Chinese_remainder_theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Chinese_remainder_theorem"}
