{"title":"Point of sale","summary":"The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.  At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.  It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service.  After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.[1][2][3]","image":"Cash_Registers.JPG.webp","url":"Point_of_sale"}
