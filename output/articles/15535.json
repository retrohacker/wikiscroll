{"title":"Exponential decay","summary":"A quantity is subject to exponential decay if it decreases at a rate proportional to its current value.  Symbolically, this process can be expressed by the following differential equation, where N is the quantity and λ (lambda) is a positive rate called the exponential decay constant:","image":"f79418cb41e0455eeccf8d8e4105e9871b2a7cf0.svg","url":"Exponential_decay"}
