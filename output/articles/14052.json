{"title":"Eastern grey kangaroo","summary":"The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a marsupial found in the eastern third of Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the great grey kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern grey male typically weighs around 66 kg (146 lb) and stands almost 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall, the scientific name, Macropus giganteus (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the red kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 90 kg (200 lb).","image":"Macropus_giganteus_-_Brunkerville.jpg.webp","url":"Eastern_grey_kangaroo"}
