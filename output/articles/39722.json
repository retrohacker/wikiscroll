{"title":"Scottish highland dance","summary":"Highland dance or Highland dancing (Scottish Gaelic: dannsa Gàidhealach)[1] is a style of competitive dancing developed in the Scottish Highlands in the 19th and 20th centuries, in the context of competitions at public events such as the Highland games. It was created from the Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalised with the conventions of ballet',[2] and has been subject to influences from outside the Highlands. Highland dancing is often performed with the accompaniment of Highland bagpipe music, and dancers wear specialised shoes called ghillies. It is now seen at nearly every modern-day Highland games event.","image":"2008-08_-_Plum_Island_and_Cowal_Games_433.jpg.webp"}
