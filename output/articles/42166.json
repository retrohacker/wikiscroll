{"title":"Statistical significance","summary":"In statistical hypothesis testing,[1][2] a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis.[3] More precisely, a study's defined significance level, denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis was assumed to be true;[4] and the p-value of a result, \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.[5] The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        ≤\n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p\\leq \\alpha }\n  \n.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12] The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5%[13] or much lower—depending on the field of study.[14]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg"}
