{"title":"Elliptic curve","summary":"In mathematics, an elliptic curve is a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point O. An elliptic curve is defined over a field K and describes points in K2, the Cartesian product of K with itself. If the field's characteristic is different from 2 and 3, then the curve can be described as a plane algebraic curve which, after a linear change of variables, consists of solutions (x,y) for:","image":"3dbe6cab1bc2c7f1c99757dc6e5d7a517cf9b4f8.svg"}
