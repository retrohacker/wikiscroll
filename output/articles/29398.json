{"title":"Merge sort","summary":"In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled as mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[2] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up merge sort appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.[3]","image":"Merge-sort-example-300px.gif","url":"Merge_sort"}
