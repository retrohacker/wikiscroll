{"title":"Huffman coding","summary":"In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper \"A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes\".[1]","image":"Huffman_tree_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Huffman_coding"}
