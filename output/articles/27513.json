{"title":"Low-pass filter","summary":"A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design. The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter.","image":"Sinc_function_(normalized).svg.png.webp","url":"Low-pass_filter"}
