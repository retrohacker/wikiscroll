{"title":"Vector field","summary":"In vector calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of space.[1]  For instance, a vector field in the plane can be visualised as a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction, each attached to a point in the plane.  Vector  fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from one point to another point.","image":"VectorField.svg.png.webp"}
