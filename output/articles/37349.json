{"title":"Recrystallization (chemistry)","summary":"In chemistry, recrystallization is a technique used to purify chemicals. By dissolving both impurities and a compound in an appropriate solvent, either the desired compound or impurities can be removed from the solution, leaving the other behind. It is named for the crystals often formed when the compound precipitates out. Alternatively, recrystallization can refer to the natural growth of larger ice crystals at the expense of smaller ones.","image":"Process-of-Crystallization-200px.png.webp","url":"Recrystallization_(chemistry)"}
