{"title":"Truck","summary":"A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed  to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle. Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a \"straight truck\" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a \"tractor\".[1]","image":"Freightliner_M2_106_6x4_2014_(14240376744).jpg.webp","url":"Truck"}
