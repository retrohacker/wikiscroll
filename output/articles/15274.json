{"title":"Eudoxus of Cnidus","summary":"Eudoxus of Cnidus (/ˈjuːdəksəs/; Ancient Greek: Εὔδοξος ὁ Κνίδιος, Eúdoxos ho Knídios; c. 408 – c. 355 BC[1][2]) was an ancient Greek astronomer, mathematician, scholar, and student of Archytas and Plato. All of his works are lost, though some fragments are preserved in Hipparchus' commentary on Aratus's poem on astronomy.[3] Sphaerics by Theodosius of Bithynia may be based on a work by Eudoxus.","image":"4a1b6c014398323cb45578581a536033fce1b28c.svg","url":"Eudoxus_of_Cnidus"}
