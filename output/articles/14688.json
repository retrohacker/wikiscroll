{"title":"Emir Abdelkader","summary":"Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine (6 September 1808 – 26 May 1883; Arabic: عبد القادر ابن محيي الدين‎ ʿAbd al-Qādir ibn Muḥy al-dīn), known as the Emir Abdelkader or Abdelkader El Hassani El Djazairi, was an Algerian religious and military leader who led a struggle against the French colonial invasion in the mid-19th century. As an Islamic scholar and Sufi who unexpectedly found himself leading a military campaign, he built up a collection of Algerian tribesmen that for many years successfully held out against one of the most advanced armies in Europe. His consistent regard for what would now be called human rights, especially as regards his Christian opponents, drew widespread admiration, and a crucial intervention to save the Christian community of Damascus from a massacre in 1860 brought honours and awards from around the world. Within Algeria, his efforts to unite the country against French invaders saw him hailed as the \"modern Jugurtha\",[2] and his ability to combine religious and political authority has led to his being acclaimed as the \"Saint among the Princes, the Prince among the Saints\".[3]","image":"Abd_al-Qadir.jpg.webp"}
