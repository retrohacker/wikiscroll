{"title":"Time series","summary":"In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.  Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.","image":"Random-data-plus-trend-r2.png.webp","url":"Time_series"}
