{"title":"Neurotransmission","summary":"Neurotransmission (Latin: transmissio \"passage, crossing\" from transmittere \"send, let through\") is the process by which signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal of a neuron (the presynaptic neuron), and bind to and react with the receptors on the dendrites of another neuron (the postsynaptic neuron) a short distance away. A similar process occurs in retrograde neurotransmission, where the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron release retrograde neurotransmitters (e.g., endocannabinoids; synthesized in response to a rise in intracellular calcium levels) that signal through receptors that are located on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, mainly at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses.[1][2][3][4]","image":"SynapseSchematic_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Neurotransmission"}
