{"title":"Wavelet","summary":"A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times. Wavelets are termed a \"brief oscillation\". A taxonomy of wavelets has been established, based on the number and direction of its pulses. Wavelets are imbued with specific properties that make them useful for signal processing.","image":"Seismic_Wavelet.jpg.webp"}
