{"title":"Forest gardening","summary":"Forest gardening is a low-maintenance, sustainable, plant-based food production and agroforestry system based on woodland ecosystems, incorporating fruit and nut trees, shrubs, herbs, vines and perennial vegetables which have yields directly useful to humans. Making use of companion planting, these can be intermixed to grow in a succession of layers to build a woodland habitat.\nForest gardening is a prehistoric method of securing food in tropical areas. In the 1980s, Robert Hart coined the term \"forest gardening\" after adapting the principles and applying them to temperate climates.[1]","image":"Forestgarden2.jpg.webp"}
