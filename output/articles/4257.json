{"title":"Arch bridge","summary":"An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today.","image":"NagasakiMeganebashi.jpg.webp","url":"Arch_bridge"}
