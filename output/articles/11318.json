{"title":"Council of Ephesus","summary":"The Council of Ephesus was a council of Christian bishops convened in Ephesus (near present-day Selçuk in Turkey) in AD 431 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius II. This third ecumenical council, an effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom,[1] confirmed the original Nicene Creed,[2] and condemned the teachings of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who held that the Virgin Mary may be called the Christotokos, \"Christ-bearer\" but not the Theotokos, \"God-bearer\". It met in June and July 431 at the Church of Mary in Ephesus in Anatolia.","image":"Concile-Ephese-Fourviere-detail.jpg.webp","url":"Council_of_Ephesus"}
