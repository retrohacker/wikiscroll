{"title":"Circuit switching","summary":"Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications network in which two network nodes establish a dedicated communications channel (circuit) through the network before the nodes may communicate. The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the communication session. The circuit functions as if the nodes were physically connected as with an electrical circuit. Circuit switching originated in analog telephone networks where the network created a dedicated circuit between two telephones for the duration of a telephone call.[1] It contrasts with message switching and packet switching used in modern digital networks in which the trunklines between switching centers carry data between many different nodes in the form of data packets without dedicated circuits.","image":"Multiplexing_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
