{"title":"RSS","summary":"RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication)[2] is a web feed[3] that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. News aggregators (or \"RSS readers\") can be built into a browser, installed on a desktop computer, or installed on a mobile device.","image":"Feed-icon.svg.png.webp"}
