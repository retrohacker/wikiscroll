{"title":"Neurology","summary":"Neurology (from Greek: νεῦρον (neûron), \"string, nerve\" and the suffix -logia, \"study of\") is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems (and their subdivisions, the autonomic and  somatic nervous systems), including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle.[1] Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system.","image":"PLoSBiol4.e126.Fig6fNeuron.jpg.webp"}
