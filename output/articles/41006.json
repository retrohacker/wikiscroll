{"title":"Small heath (butterfly)","summary":"The small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus) is a butterfly species belonging to the family Nymphalidae, classified within the subfamily Satyrinae (commonly known as \"the browns\"). It is the smallest butterfly in this subfamily. The small heath is diurnal and flies with a noticeable fluttering flight pattern near the ground. It rests with closed wings when not in flight.[3][4][5] It is widespread in colonies throughout the grasslands of Eurasia and north-western Africa, preferring drier habitats than other Coenonympha, such as salt marshes, alpine meadows, wetlands, and grasslands near water (i.e. streams).[6][7][8] However, habitat loss caused by human activities has led to a decline in populations in some locations.[4]","image":"Small_heath_(Coenonympha_pamphilus)_P.jpg.webp"}
