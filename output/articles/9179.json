{"title":"Chain rule","summary":"In calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the composition of two differentiable functions f and g in terms of the derivatives f and g. More precisely, if h = f ∘ g {\\displaystyle h=f\\circ g} is the function such that h ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) {\\displaystyle h(x)=f(g(x))} for every x, then the chain rule is, in Lagrange's notation,","image":"a14345f3938c66b1fde08e18d8b301a59c5775a5.svg","url":"Chain_rule"}
