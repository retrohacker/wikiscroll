{"title":"Pericardium","summary":"The pericardium, also called pericardial sac, is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels.[1]  It has two layers, an outer layer made of strong connective tissue (fibrous pericardium), and an inner layer made of serous membrane (serous pericardium).[2][3] It encloses the pericardial cavity, which contains pericardial fluid,[2] and defines the middle mediastinum.  It separates the heart from interference of other structures, protects it against infection and blunt trauma, and lubricates the heart's movements.","image":"Blausen_0470_HeartWall.png.webp","url":"Pericardium"}
