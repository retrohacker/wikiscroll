{"title":"The Inheritance Cycle","summary":"The Inheritance Cycle is a tetralogy of young adult high fantasy novels written by American author Christopher Paolini. Set in the fictional world of Alagaësia (/æləˈɡeɪziə/), the novels focus on the adventures of a teenage boy named Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, as they struggle to overthrow the evil king Galbatorix. The series was originally intended to be a trilogy (named the \"Inheritance Trilogy\") until Paolini announced on October 30, 2007, while working on the third novel, that he believed the story was too complex to conclude in just three books.","image":"Inheritance_Cycle_cover.jpg.webp"}
