{"title":"Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning","summary":"Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)[1] is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. \"Refrigeration\" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation as HVAC&R or HVACR, or \"ventilation\" is dropped, as in HACR (as in the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers).","image":"Rooftop_Packaged_Units.JPG.webp","url":"Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning"}
