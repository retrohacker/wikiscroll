{"title":"Riemann integral","summary":"In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval.  It was presented to the faculty at the University of Göttingen in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868.[1] For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration.","image":"Integral_as_region_under_curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Riemann_integral"}
