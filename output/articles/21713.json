{"title":"Implicit function theorem","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in multivariable calculus, the implicit function theorem[lower-alpha 1] is a tool that allows relations to be converted to functions of several real variables. It does so by representing the relation as the graph of a function. There may not be a single function whose graph can represent the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the domain of the relation. The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.","image":"Implicit_circle.svg.png.webp","url":"Implicit_function_theorem"}
