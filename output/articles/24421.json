{"title":"Karnaugh map","summary":"The Karnaugh map (KM or K-map) is a method of simplifying Boolean algebra expressions. Maurice Karnaugh introduced it in 1953[1][2] as a refinement of Edward W. Veitch's 1952 Veitch chart,[3][4] which was a rediscovery of Allan Marquand's 1881 logical diagram[5] aka Marquand diagram[4] but with a focus now set on its utility for switching circuits.[4] Veitch charts are therefore also known as Marquand–Veitch diagrams,[4] and Karnaugh maps as Karnaugh–Veitch maps (KV maps).","image":"K-map_6%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C14_anti-race.svg.png.webp"}
