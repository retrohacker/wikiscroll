{"title":"Squid","summary":"Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight arms and two tentacles. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.","image":"Sepioteuthis_sepioidea_(Caribbean_Reef_Squid).jpg.webp"}
