{"title":"Altitude","summary":"Altitude or height (also sometimes known as depth) is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \"up\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The exact definition and reference datum varies according to the context (e.g., aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, or atmospheric pressure). Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.","image":"Boeing_737_view_1.jpg.webp","url":"Altitude"}
