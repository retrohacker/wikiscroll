{"title":"Divisor","summary":"In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n {\\displaystyle n} , also called a factor of n {\\displaystyle n} , is an integer m {\\displaystyle m} that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n {\\displaystyle n} . In this case, one also says that n {\\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m . {\\displaystyle m.} An integer n {\\displaystyle n} is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer m {\\displaystyle m} if m {\\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n {\\displaystyle n} ; this implies dividing n {\\displaystyle n} by m {\\displaystyle m} leaves no remainder.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Divisor"}
