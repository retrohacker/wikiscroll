{"title":"Mantle (geology)","summary":"A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body bounded below by a core and above by a crust. Mantles are made of rock or ices, and are generally the largest and most massive layer of the planetary body. Mantles are characteristic of planetary bodies that have undergone differentiation by density.  All terrestrial planets (including Earth), a number of asteroids, and some planetary moons have mantles.","image":"Earth_poster.svg.png.webp","url":"Mantle_(geology)"}
