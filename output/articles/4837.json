{"title":"Atmospheric pressure","summary":"Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure (after the barometer),    is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa (1,013.25 hPa; 1,013.25 mbar), which is equivalent to 760 mm Hg, 29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi.[1] The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth; that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm.","image":"Day5pressureforecast.png.webp","url":"Atmospheric_pressure"}
