{"title":"Sampling (statistics)","summary":"In statistics, quality assurance, and survey methodology, sampling is the selection of a subset (a statistical sample) of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. Statisticians attempt to collect samples that are representative of the population in question. Sampling has lower costs and faster data collection than measuring the entire population and can provide insights in cases where it is infeasible to sample an entire population.","image":"Simple_random_sampling.PNG.webp","url":"Sampling_(statistics)"}
