{"title":"Cauchy–Riemann equations","summary":"In the field of complex analysis in mathematics, the Cauchy–Riemann equations, named after Augustin Cauchy and Bernhard Riemann, consist of a system of two partial differential equations which, together with certain continuity and differentiability criteria, form a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex function to be holomorphic (complex differentiable).  This system of equations first appeared in the work of Jean le Rond d'Alembert.[1] Later, Leonhard Euler connected this system to the analytic functions.[2] Cauchy[3] then used these equations to construct his theory of functions. Riemann's dissertation on the theory of functions appeared in 1851.[4]","image":"Cauchy-Riemann.png.webp"}
