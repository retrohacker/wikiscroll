{"title":"Client–server model","summary":"Client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host  runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests.\nExamples of computer applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.","image":"Client-server-model.svg.png.webp"}
