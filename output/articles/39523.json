{"title":"Savings and loan association","summary":"A savings and loan association (S&L), or thrift institution,  is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings deposits and making mortgage and other loans.  The terms \"S&L\" or \"thrift\" are mainly used in the United States; similar institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries include building societies and trustee savings banks. They are often mutually held (often called mutual savings banks), meaning that the depositors and borrowers are members with voting rights, and have the ability to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organization like the members of a credit union or the policyholders of a mutual insurance company.  While it is possible for an S&L to be a joint-stock company, and even publicly traded, in such instances it is no longer truly a mutual association, and depositors and borrowers no longer have membership rights and managerial control. By law, thrifts can have no more than 20 percent of their lending in commercial loans—their focus on mortgage and consumer loans makes them particularly vulnerable to housing downturns such as the deep one the U.S. experienced in 2007.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Savings_and_loan_association"}
