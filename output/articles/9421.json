{"title":"Chatbot","summary":"A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.[1] Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse, while none of them can pass the standard Turing test.[2] The term \"ChatterBot\" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.[3]","image":"Automated_online_assistant.png.webp"}
