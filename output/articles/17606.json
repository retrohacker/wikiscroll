{"title":"Gene duplication","summary":"Gene duplication (or chromosomal duplication or      gene amplification) is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution. It can be defined as any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene.  Gene duplications can arise as products of several types of errors in DNA replication and repair machinery as well as through fortuitous capture by selfish genetic elements.  Common sources of gene duplications include ectopic recombination,  retrotransposition event, aneuploidy, polyploidy, and replication slippage.[1]","image":"Gene-duplication.png.webp","url":"Gene_duplication"}
