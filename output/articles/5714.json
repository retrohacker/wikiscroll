{"title":"Basis (linear algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, a set B of vectors in a vector space V is called a basis if every element of V may be written in a unique way as a finite linear combination of elements of B. The coefficients of this linear combination are referred to as components or coordinates of the vector with respect to B. The elements of a basis are called basis vectors.","image":"3d_two_bases_same_vector.svg.png.webp","url":"Basis_(linear_algebra)"}
