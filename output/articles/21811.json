{"title":"Indian Plate","summary":"The Indian Plate or India Plate is a minor tectonic plate straddling the Equator in the Eastern Hemisphere. Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, India broke away from the other fragments of Gondwana 100 million years ago and began moving north.[2] Once fused with the adjacent Australian Plate to form a single Indo-Australian Plate, recent studies suggest that India and Australia have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer.[3]  The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia—i.e. the Indian subcontinent—and a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and western Indonesia,[4][5] and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan and Balochistan.[6][7][8]","image":"IndianPlate.png.webp"}
