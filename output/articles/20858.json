{"title":"Hour record","summary":"The hour record is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle from a stationary start.  Cyclists attempt this record alone on the track without other competitors present.  It is considered one of the most prestigious records in cycling. Since it was first set, cyclists ranging from unknown amateurs to well-known professionals have held the record, adding to its prestige and allure. There is now one unified record for upright bicycles meeting the requirements of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).  Hour-record attempts for UCI bikes are made in a velodrome.","image":"James-moore.jpg.webp","url":"Hour_record"}
