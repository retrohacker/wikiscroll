{"title":"Dynein","summary":"Dynein is a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins that move along microtubules in cells. They convert the chemical energy stored in ATP to mechanical work. Dynein transports various cellular cargos, provides forces and displacements important in mitosis, and drives the beat of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. All of these functions rely on dynein's ability to move towards the minus-end of the microtubules, known as retrograde transport, thus, they are called \"minus-end directed motors\". In contrast, most kinesin motor proteins move toward the microtubules' plus end.","image":"DyneinHeavyChainOnMT.png.webp"}
