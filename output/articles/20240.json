{"title":"Hexadecimal","summary":"In mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or hex) numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the decimal system representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols \"0\"–\"9\" to represent values 0 to 9, and \"A\"–\"F\" (or alternatively \"a\"–\"f\") to represent values from 10 to 15.","image":"Bruce_Martin_hexadecimal_notation_proposal.png.webp","url":"Hexadecimal"}
