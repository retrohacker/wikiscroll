{"title":"Planets beyond Neptune","summary":"Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and continued at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune,[1] speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.[2]","image":"Percival_Lowell_observing_Venus_from_the_Lowell_Observatory_in_1914.jpg.webp","url":"Planets_beyond_Neptune"}
