{"title":"Fading","summary":"In wireless communications, fading is variation of the attenuation of a signal with various variables. These variables include time, geographical position, and radio frequency.  Fading is often modeled as a random process.  A fading channel is a communication channel that experiences fading. In wireless systems, fading may either be due to multipath propagation, referred to as multipath-induced fading, weather (particularly rain), or shadowing from obstacles affecting the wave propagation, sometimes referred to as shadow fading.","image":"Radio_propagation_noise.jpg.webp","url":"Fading"}
