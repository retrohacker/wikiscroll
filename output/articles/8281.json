{"title":"Call stack","summary":"In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.  This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just \"the stack\". Although maintenance of the call stack is important for the proper functioning of most software, the details are normally hidden and automatic in high-level programming languages. Many computer instruction sets provide special instructions for manipulating stacks.","image":"Call_stack_layout.svg.png.webp","url":"Call_stack"}
