{"title":"\"Hello, World!\" program","summary":"A \"Hello, World!\" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message \"Hello, World!\". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.","image":"Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg.webp","url":"\"Hello,_World!\"_program"}
