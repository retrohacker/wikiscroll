{"title":"President (corporate title)","summary":"A president is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group.[1][2] The relationship between a president and a chief executive officer varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similarchief operating officer, the title of corporate president as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a \"C-suite\" designation, such as \"president and chief executive officer\" or \"president and chief operating officer\") is also loosely defined; the president is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various vice presidents (including senior vice president and executive vice president), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of a president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws like Robert's Rules of Order (e.g. the president can make an \"executive decision\" only if the bylaws allow for it).[3]","image":"AGM_Annual_General_Meeting_of_a_typical_small_(141_member)_volunteer_organisation.jpg.webp","url":"President_(corporate_title)"}
