{"title":"Probability","summary":"Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true.  The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.[note 1][1][2] The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).","image":"Nuvola_apps_atlantik.png.webp"}
