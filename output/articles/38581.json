{"title":"Router (computing)","summary":"A router[lower-alpha 1] is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.  Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets.  A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.[2]","image":"Ciscosystemsrouteratcern.jpg.webp","url":"Router_(computing)"}
