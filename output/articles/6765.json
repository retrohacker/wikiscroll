{"title":"Black","summary":"Black is a color which results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and gray.[1] It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness.[2] Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.[2]","image":"Tutankhamun_jackal_(blacked).png.webp"}
