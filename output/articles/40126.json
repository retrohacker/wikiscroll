{"title":"Server (computing)","summary":"In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called \"clients\". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called \"services\", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[1] Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.[2]","image":"Client-server-model.svg.png.webp"}
