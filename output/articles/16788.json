{"title":"Fractional distillation","summary":"Fractional distillation  is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions. Chemical compounds are separated by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the mixture will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C (45 °F) from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used.","image":"Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg.png.webp","url":"Fractional_distillation"}
