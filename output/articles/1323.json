{"title":"Manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.","image":"BoysSurfaceTopView.PNG.webp","url":"A%2fManifold"}
