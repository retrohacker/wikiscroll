{"title":"Divide-and-conquer algorithm","summary":"In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.","image":"Merge_sort_algorithm_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Divide-and-conquer_algorithm"}
