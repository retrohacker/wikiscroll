{"title":"Baháʼí Faith and gender equality","summary":"One of the fundamental teachings of the Baháʼí Faith is that men and women are equal, except in some minor instances,[1] and that equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard essential for the unification of the planet and a prerequisite for peace. Baháʼí teachings stress the importance of implementing this principle in individual, family, and community life. Nevertheless, the Baháʼí notion of the full spiritual and social equality of the two sexes does not imply sameness, so that gender distinction and differentiation are observed in certain areas of life. Significantly, while women can and do serve in an extensive range of elected and appointed positions within the faith at both national and international levels, they are not permitted to serve as members of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith.","image":"Bahai_star.svg.png.webp","url":"Baháʼí_Faith_and_gender_equality"}
