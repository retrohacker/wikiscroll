{"title":"Dial-up Internet access","summary":"Dial-up Internet access is a form of Internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line.  Dial-up connections use  modems to decode audio signals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from the latter two devices to send to another modem.","image":"V34_modem.jpg.webp"}
