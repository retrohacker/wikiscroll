{"title":"A* search algorithm","summary":"A* (pronounced \"A-star\") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.[1] One major practical drawback is its O ( b d ) {\\displaystyle O(b^{d})} space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,[2] as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.[3]","image":"c99d691c81f015266d1626ef381d2a1a49466fbb.svg","url":"A*_search_algorithm"}
