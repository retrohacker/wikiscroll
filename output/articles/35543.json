{"title":"Pope Soter","summary":"Pope Soter (Latin: Soterius) was the twelfth bishop of Rome from c. 167 to his death in c. 174.[1] According to the Annuario Pontificio, the dates may have ranged from 162–168 to 170–177.[2] He was born in Fondi, Campania, today Lazio region, Italy.[3]  Soter is known for declaring that marriage was valid only as a sacrament blessed by a priest and also for formally inaugurating Easter as an annual festival in Rome.[4] His name, from Greek Σωτήριος from σωτήρ \"saviour\", would be his baptismal name, as his lifetime predates the tradition of adopting papal names.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Pope_Soter"}
