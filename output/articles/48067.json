{"title":"Wavelength","summary":"In physics, the wavelength is the spatial period of a periodic wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.[1][2]  It is the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase on the wave, such as two adjacent crests, troughs, or zero crossings, and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns.[3][4] The inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency. Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ).\nThe term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.[5]","image":"Sine_wavelength.svg.png.webp"}
