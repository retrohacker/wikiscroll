{"title":"Equivalence class","summary":"In mathematics, when the elements of some set S {\\displaystyle S} have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an equivalence relation) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set S {\\displaystyle S} into equivalence classes. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} belong to the same equivalence class if, and only if, they are equivalent.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Equivalence_class"}
