{"title":"Classical mechanics","summary":"Classical mechanics[note 1] is a physical theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. For objects governed by classical mechanics, if the present state is known, it is possible to predict how it will move in the future (determinism), and how it has moved in the past (reversibility).","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Classical_mechanics"}
