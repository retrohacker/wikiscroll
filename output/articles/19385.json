{"title":"Haiku","summary":"Haiku (俳句, listen ) is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases that contain a kireji, or \"cutting word\",[1] 17 on (phonetic units similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern,[2] and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senryū.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
