{"title":"Witch of Agnesi","summary":"In mathematics, the witch of Agnesi (Italian pronunciation: [aɲˈɲeːzi, -eːsi; -ɛːzi]) is a cubic plane curve defined from two diametrically opposite points of a circle. It gets its name from Italian mathematician Maria Gaetana Agnesi, and from a mistranslation of an Italian word for a sailing sheet. Before Agnesi, the same curve was studied by Fermat, Grandi, and Newton.","image":"Witch_of_Agnesi%2C_a_1%2C_2%2C_4%2C_8.svg.png.webp","url":"Witch_of_Agnesi"}
