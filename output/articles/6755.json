{"title":"Bitwise operation","summary":"In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.","image":"0...15_AND.svg.png.webp","url":"Bitwise_operation"}
