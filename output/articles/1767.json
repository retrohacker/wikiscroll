{"title":"AV idol","summary":"An AV idol (AVアイドル, Ēbui aidoru), also known as adult video idol or AV actress (AV女優, Ēbui joyū), is a Japanese idol who works in the pornographic business, often both as an actress as well as a model as the video performances vary widely, from suggestive softcore imagery to hardcore pornography. The industry is noted for having frequent turnovers; since the dawn of the AV industry in the early 1980s, hundreds of AV idols have debuted every year, with an average career span of about a year, appearing in five or ten videos during that time.[1] Few notable AV idols have careers spanning longer than a decade, have a wide general public recognition, or make a significant impact on the industry in some other manner.[2]","image":"Pornographies_of_Japan.jpg.webp"}
