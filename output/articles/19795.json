{"title":"Hausdorff space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a Hausdorff space, separated space or T2 space is a topological space where for any two distinct points there exist neighbourhoods of each which are disjoint from each other. Of the many separation axioms that can be imposed on a topological space, the \"Hausdorff condition\" (T2) is the most frequently used and discussed. It implies the uniqueness of limits of sequences, nets, and filters.[1]","image":"Hausdorff_space.svg.png.webp","url":"Hausdorff_space"}
