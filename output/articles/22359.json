{"title":"Inverse-square law","summary":"In science, an inverse-square law is any scientific law stating that a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.","image":"Inverse_square_law.svg.png.webp","url":"Inverse-square_law"}
