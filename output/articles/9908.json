{"title":"Christmas Island red crab","summary":"The Christmas Island red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) is a species of land crab that is endemic to Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean.[1][2] Although restricted to a relatively small area, an estimated 43.7 million adult red crabs once lived on Christmas Island alone,[3] but the accidental introduction of the yellow crazy ant is believed to have killed about 10–15 million of these in recent years.[4] Christmas Island red crabs make an annual mass migration to the sea to lay their eggs in the ocean.[5] Although its population is under great assault by the ants,[6] as of 2020 the red crab had not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and it was not listed on their Red List.[7] The crab's annual mass migration to the sea for spawning is described as an \"epic\" event. Millions emerge at the same time, halting road traffic and covering the ground in a thick carpet of crabs.[8]","image":"Christmas_Island_(5774532171).jpg.webp","url":"Christmas_Island_red_crab"}
