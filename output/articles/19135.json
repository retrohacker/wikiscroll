{"title":"Guineafowl","summary":"Guineafowl (/ˈɡɪnifaʊl/; sometimes called \"pet speckled hens\" or \"original fowl\") are birds of the family Numididae in the order Galliformes. They are endemic to  Africa and rank among the oldest of the gallinaceous birds. Phylogenetically, they branched off from the core Galliformes after the Cracidae (chachalacas, guans, and curassows) and before the Odontophoridae (New World quail).  An Eocene fossil lineage Telecrex has been associated with guineafowl; Telecrex inhabited Mongolia, and may have given rise to the oldest of the true phasianids, such as blood pheasants and eared pheasants, which evolved into high-altitude, montane-adapted species with the rise of the Tibetan Plateau.  While modern guineafowl species are endemic to Africa, the helmeted guineafowl has been introduced as a domesticated bird widely elsewhere.[1]","image":"Feder1.jpg.webp","url":"Guineafowl"}
