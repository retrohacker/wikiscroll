{"title":"Stochastic process","summary":"In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic (/stoʊˈkæstɪk/) or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule.[1][4][5] Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology,[6] chemistry,[7] ecology,[8] neuroscience,[9] physics,[10] image processing, signal processing,[11] control theory,[12]  information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[17][18][19]","image":"Nuvola_apps_atlantik.png.webp"}
