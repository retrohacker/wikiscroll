{"title":"Expulsion of the Acadians","summary":"The Expulsion of the Acadians, also known as the Great Upheaval, the Great Expulsion, the Great Deportation, and the Deportation of the Acadians (French: Le Grand Dérangement or Déportation des Acadiens), was the forced removal by the British of the Acadian people from the present-day Canadian Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and the present-day U.S. state of Maine — parts of an area historically known as Acadia, causing the death of thousands of people.[lower-alpha 2] The Expulsion (1755–1764) occurred during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War)[lower-alpha 3] and was part of the British military campaign against New France. The British first deported Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies, and after 1758, transported additional Acadians to Britain and France. In all, of the 14,100 Acadians in the region, approximately 11,500 were deported.[7][lower-alpha 4] A census of 1764 indicates that 2,600 Acadians remained in the colony having eluded capture.[9]","image":"A_View_of_the_Plundering_and_Burning_of_the_City_of_Grymross%2C_by_Thomas_Davies%2C_1758.JPG.webp","url":"Expulsion_of_the_Acadians"}
