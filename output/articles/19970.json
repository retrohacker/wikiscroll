{"title":"Helicase","summary":"Helicases are a class of enzymes thought to be vital to all organisms. Their main function is to unpack an organism's genes. They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands such as DNA and RNA (hence helic- + -ase), using energy from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases, representing the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases.[1] The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases.[2] Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases.","image":"Helicase.png.webp","url":"Helicase"}
