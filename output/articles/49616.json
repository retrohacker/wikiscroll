{"title":"Évariste Galois","summary":"Évariste Galois (/ɡælˈwɑː/;[1] French: [evaʁist ɡalwa]; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician and political activist. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem that had been open for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory,[2] two major branches of abstract algebra. He was a staunch republican and was heavily involved in the political turmoil that surrounded the French Revolution of 1830.  As a result of his political activism, he was arrested repeatedly, serving one jail sentence of several months.  For reasons that remain obscure, shortly after his release from prison, he fought in a duel, and died of the wounds he suffered.[3]","image":"Evariste_galois.jpg.webp","url":"Évariste_Galois"}
