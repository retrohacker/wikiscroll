He is the extremely religious, good-natured, cheery next-door neighbor to the Simpson family and is generally loathed by Homer Simpson – though there are numerous instances where the two are portrayed as good friends. A scrupulous and devout Evangelical Christian, he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield's residents and is generally considered a pillar of the Springfield community.","image":"Ned_Flanders.png.webp","url":"Ned_Flanders"}
