{"title":"Abuse","summary":"Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of a thing, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit.[1] Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression. To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves.[2] Some sources describe abuse as \"socially constructed\", which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.[3]","image":"Closed_Access_logo_transparent.svg.png.webp","url":"Abuse"}
