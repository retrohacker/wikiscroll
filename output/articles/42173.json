{"title":"Status of Jerusalem","summary":"The status of Jerusalem is disputed in both international law and diplomatic practice, with both the Israelis and Palestinians claiming Jerusalem as their capital city.[1][2][3][4] The dispute has been described as \"one of the most intractable issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\", with conflicting claims to sovereignty over the city or parts of it, and access to its holy sites.[5] The main dispute revolves around the legal status of East Jerusalem and especially the Old City of Jerusalem, while broader agreement exists regarding future Israeli presence in West Jerusalem in accordance with Israel's internationally recognised borders.[1] The majority of United Nations (UN) member states hold the view that the final status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiation, and have therefore favored locating their embassies in Tel Aviv prior to a final status agreement. However, in the late 2010s, the international consensus to abstain from expressing a viewpoint on the city's final status has shown signs of fragility, with Russia, the United States, and Australia adopting new policy positions. Furthermore, the proposal that Jerusalem should be the future capital of both Israel and Palestine has also gained international support,[6] with endorsements coming from both the United Nations[7][8] and the European Union.[9][10]","image":"Jerusalem-2013(2)-Aerial-Temple_Mount-(south_exposure).jpg.webp"}
