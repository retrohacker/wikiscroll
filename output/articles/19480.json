{"title":"Halting problem","summary":"In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.","image":"76728da59b2423fe6fd133a8f6b14593f4c54716.svg","url":"Halting_problem"}
