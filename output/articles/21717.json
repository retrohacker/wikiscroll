{"title":"Imprinting (psychology)","summary":"In psychology and ethology, imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive learning (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behaviour. It was first used to describe situations in which an animal or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is therefore said to be \"imprinted\" onto the subject. Imprinting is hypothesized to have a critical period.","image":"Christian_Moullec_4.jpg.webp","url":"Imprinting_(psychology)"}
