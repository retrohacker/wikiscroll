{"title":"0.999...","summary":"In mathematics, 0.999... (also written as 0.9, in repeating decimal notation) denotes the repeating decimal consisting of an unending sequence of 9s after the decimal point. This repeating decimal represents the smallest number no less than every decimal number in the sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...); that is, the supremum of this sequence.[1] This number is equal to 1. In other words, \"0.999...\" is not \"almost exactly\" or \"very, very nearly but not quite\" 1  –  rather, \"0.999...\" and \"1\" represent exactly the same number.","image":"999_Perspective.svg.png.webp"}
