{"title":"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol","summary":"The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP /ˈɛldæp/) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.[1] Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.[2]  As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory.  Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
